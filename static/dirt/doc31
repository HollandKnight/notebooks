THIS REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this Agreement) is entered into as of the

by and among BC DEVELOPMENT CO., LLC, a Missouri limited liability company or its assigns (Buyer) and ROCKY BLUFF, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited liability company and STANDRIDGE & JACKSON DEVELOPMENT, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited
liability company (collectively, Seller), for the purchase of certain real property more particularly described herein. 
ARTICLE 1 - SALE OF PROPERTY 
1.1 Property To Be Sold. Subject to the terms and provisions hereof, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer and Buyer agrees to purchase
from Seller upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement:  1.1.1 Fee simple title to the land described
and/or shown on Exhibit A attached hereto, together with all privileges, rights, easements and appurtenances belonging to such land, including without limitation, all right, title and interest (if any) of Seller in and to any
streets, alleys, passages, usufructs and other rights-of-way or appurtenances included in, adjacent to or used in connection with such land and all right, title and interest (if any) of Seller in all mineral and development rights appurtenant to
such land (collectively, the Land).  1.1.2 All of Sellers right, title and interest, if any,
in and to all buildings, structures and other improvements and all fixtures, systems and facilities located on the Land (the Improvements). 
1.1.3 All of Sellers right, title and interest, if any, in and to all furniture, equipment, machinery, inventories,
supplies, signs and other tangible personal property of every kind and nature, installed, located or situated on or used in connection with the operation of the Land or Improvements, including, without limitation, the personal property listed on
Exhibit B attached hereto (the Personal Property).  1.1.4 All of
Sellers rights in all leases and other occupancy agreements covering any portion of the Land or Improvements (the Leases), including all of the leases listed on the Rent Rolls attached hereto as Exhibit C
(the Rent Rolls) and any leases that may be subsequently entered into in accordance with this Agreement, and including Sellers rights to any tenant deposits held by Seller (the Tenant Deposits) pursuant to the Leases.
 1.1.5 All of Sellers right, title and interest, if any, in all intangible assets of any nature relating
to the Land, the Improvements or the Personal Property, including, without limitation, all of Sellers right, title, and interest in all (i) warranties and guaranties relating to the Improvements or Personal Property in the possession of
Seller, (ii) all use, occupancy, building and operating licenses, permits, approvals, and development rights (iii) any trade name or names used or utilized in connection with the Land and Improvements, (iv) all plans and
specifications related to the Land and Improvements, in each case to the extent that Seller may legally transfer the same (the Intangible Property).   
1 


1.1.6 All of Sellers rights, if any, in all service contracts (other
than management and leasing contracts) affecting the Land or Improvements as set forth on Exhibit D attached hereto (the Property Contracts), to the extent Buyer assumes the same in accordance with Section 3.4
below.  1.1.7 All rights, which the Seller may have, if any, in and to any tenant data, telephone numbers and
listings, all master keys and keys to common areas, all good will, if any, and any and all other rights, privileges and appurtenances owned by Seller and related to or used in connection with the existing business operation of the Land and
Improvements (the Miscellaneous Property).  1.1.8 The Land and Improvements are hereinafter
sometimes referred to collectively as the Real Property and the Real Property, Personal Property, Leases, Tenant Deposits, Intangible Property, the Property Contracts and the Miscellaneous Property, are hereinafter sometimes referred to
collectively as the Property.  1.2 Purchase and Sale. Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller and Seller
agrees to sell to Buyer all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Property, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
1.3 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Property (the Purchase Price) shall collectively be Fifteen Million
Three Hundred Thousand and 00/100s Dollars ($15,300,000.00), and shall be allocated as set forth on Schedule 1.3 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller by Buyer on the Closing Date (as
defined below), plus or minus all adjustments or credits as set forth herein, by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price was determined based on a projected
aggregate NOI (as defined below) of One Million Two Hundred Sixty Two Thousand Three Hundred Ninety Six and no/100 Dollars ($1,262,396.00) for the first full year of the term of each of the Leases, and thus a capitalization rate of 8.25%
(Capitalization Rate). For purposes of this Agreement, NOI shall mean gross rent income received less (i) all tax deductible operating expenses, (ii) any additional cash outflows, (iii) all repair costs and
(iv) the amortized cost of any capital improvements needed over the remaining term of each Lease. If prior to Closing the NOI for the first year of the term of any Lease has not been established (such Lease being an, Unmatured
Lease), Buyer and Seller agree to adjust the allocated Purchase Price attributable to the parcel subject to such Unmatured Lease in the event that the first-year NOI that is allocated for such parcel differs from the projected NOI as set forth
on Schedule 1.3 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference by a margin greater than three percent (3%). Any adjustment to the Purchase Price based on the foregoing, whether in favor of the Buyer or the Seller, shall be made after
all of the Unmatured Leases have had their respective NOI properly established and the party entitled to such adjustment shall be paid the difference between the allocated Purchase Price and the allocated Purchase Price as adjusted, by immediately
available federal funds within twenty (20) days after notice of the same by Buyer or Seller.   
2 


1.4 Deposit. Within one (1) Business Day after the Effective Date, Buyer shall
deliver to Chicago Title Company, 5501 LBJ Freeway, Suite 200, Dallas, Texas, Attn: Leslie B. Wheeler (Escrow Holder), a good faith deposit in the amount of Twenty-Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($25,000.00) (the Initial
Deposit), and within one (1) business day following the end of the Due Diligence Period (defined below in Section 3.2), provided that Buyer has not previously terminated this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to Escrow Holder an
additional good faith deposit (Additional Deposit) of Seventy-Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($75,000.00). The Initial Deposit and the Additional Deposit (including any interest earned thereon) shall be collectively referred to as the
Deposit. The Deposit shall be held in an insured, interest-bearing account with interest accruing for the benefit of Buyer. The Deposit shall be applied to the Purchase Price if the Closing occurs. After the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period (defined below in Section 3.2), the Deposit shall be nonrefundable to Buyer unless escrow fails to close due to Sellers breach or default under this Agreement, there is a failure of a representation or warranty by Seller
to be true and correct as of the Closing, there is a failure of a condition precedent set forth in Section 5.4, there is a casualty or condemnation, or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, and shall constitute liquidated damages
to Seller if escrow fails to close solely as a result of Buyers default as provided in Section 6.1 below. In the event Buyer shall elect to terminate this Agreement during the Due Diligence Period (defined below in Section 3.2), the
Deposit shall be returned to Buyer as provided in Section 3.6 below.  1.5 Closing Date. 
1.5.1 The closing (Closing, sometimes referred to herein as the Close of Escrow) means the date
Escrow Holder disburses funds in accordance with this Agreement and is irrevocably committed to record the Deed (defined below in Section 5.6.1) in favor of Buyer and shall take place through an escrow opened with Escrow Holder on or before the
date which is sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (defined below in Section 3.2) (the Closing Date), or upon such earlier date as Buyer may elect upon five (5) Business Days notice to
Seller. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Closing occur earlier than one hundred five (105) days after the Effective Date, unless Buyer shall have expressly waived this contingency in a separately
executed written document.  1.5.2 Until the date that is five (5) Business Days before the scheduled
Closing Date, Buyer shall have the right to unilaterally extend the Closing Date from time to time, not to exceed in the aggregate thirty (30) additional days beyond the Closing Date provided in Section 1.5.1 above provided that on or
before the originally scheduled Closing Date Buyer provides written notice to the Seller (Closing Extension Notice) and increases the Deposit by Twenty-Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($25,000) (the Closing Extension
Deposit). The Closing Extension Deposit shall be deemed part of the Deposit and shall be subject to terms and conditions set forth in Section 1.4. 
ARTICLE 2 
TITLE AND SURVEY 
2.1 Title and Survey. During the Due Diligence Period (defined below in Section 3.2), Buyer, at Buyers cost and
expense, may obtain a preliminary title report or commitment (the Preliminary Report) from Escrow Agent (referred to herein in such capacity as, the Title 
 
3 



Company), together with legible copies of all recorded encumbrances and exceptions to title, no later than seven (7) Business Days after the Effective Date, as well as an existing
survey, if any, from Seller. Buyer shall, at its option and at its expense, (i) conduct UCC searches covering Seller and the Property (the UCC Searches) and (ii) order an update of the existing survey of the Real Property by a
licensed surveyor or registered professional engineer (the Survey).  2.2 Review of the Preliminary Report,
Survey and UCC Searches; Objection; Approval or Termination. Within twenty (20) days of Buyers receipt of the Preliminary Report or within ten (10) days after delivery of any supplement to the Preliminary Title Report
(Supplemental Report), Buyer may deliver to Seller a notice (the Title Objection Notice) setting forth (i) any matters shown on the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey or UCC Searches to which Buyer objects
and requires be eliminated, (ii) any modifications, supplements or other modifications of any the legal description, description of exceptions or other matters set forth in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report or Survey, and
(iii) any endorsements or other affirmative title insurance coverage required to be included in the Title Policy (collectively, clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) herein shall be referred to hereinafter as the Title Objections).
Buyer may make its determination of whether any of the matters contained in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey or UCC Searches (as applicable) are appropriate or are objectionable in its sole discretion. Buyers failure to give
the Title Objection Notice shall be deemed to constitute Buyers approval of all matters disclosed in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey, or UCC Searches (as applicable), and such matters shall constitute Permitted Exceptions.
If Buyer delivers a Title Objection Notice, Seller may, within five (5) Business Days from the receipt of Buyers notice, provide Buyer with written notice of Sellers election to remove or otherwise cure to Buyers satisfaction
the Title Objections prior to the Closing (Seller Response Notice); provided however, and notwithstanding Buyers inclusion or lack thereof in any Title Objection Notice, Seller shall be obligated to eliminate all monetary liens or
encumbrances, and any exceptions created or consented to by Seller after the Effective Date, unless approved in writing by Buyer, which Seller shall cause to be released at Closing. Except as otherwise set forth herein, Seller shall not be obligated
to cure any objection by Buyer. If Sellers Response Notice does not include all items contained in any Title Objection Notice, then Buyer may either (i) elect to terminate this Agreement, or (ii) waive in writing its prior
disapproval of such item and accept title subject to such previously disapproved item by delivering notice of Buyers election to Seller within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of the Seller Response Notice. If Seller fails to
timely deliver the Seller Response Notice within such five (5) Business Day period, then Seller shall be deemed to have elected not to cure all of the disapproved matters set forth in Buyers Title Objection Notice, and Buyer may either
(i) elect to terminate this Agreement, or (ii) waive in writing its prior disapproval of such item and accept title subject to such previously disapproved item by delivering notice of Buyers election to Seller within five
(5) Business Days of the date on which Seller was otherwise to deliver the Seller Response Notice. If Buyer fails to deliver its notice of election to terminate this Agreement or waive its prior disapproval within such five (5) day
business period following Sellers Response Notice (or the date on which Seller was to provide a Sellers Response Notice), Buyer shall be deemed to have approved of those matters that Seller has elected not to cure, and such matters shall
constitute Permitted Exceptions. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 2.2, the provisions of Section 3.6 shall apply.   
4 


2.3 Required Title Condition. Title to the Property shall be conveyed to Buyer
subject only to the following permitted encumbrances: (a) current, non-delinquent real estate taxes and assessments, (B) the matters set forth in the Preliminary Report, the Supplemental Report, Survey or UCC Searches or approved or deemed
approved pursuant to Section 2.2 above, (c) the Leases, and (d) any other matters approved in writing or deemed approved by Buyer. 
ARTICLE 3 
INSPECTION, DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD AND FINANCING PERIOD 
3.1 Access. From and after the Effective Date through the Closing (but in all events subject to the tenants rights under the
Leases) Buyer, personally or through its authorized agent or representatives, shall be entitled, upon reasonable advance written notice to Seller or Sellers agent, to enter upon the Property during normal business hours and shall have the
right to make such investigations, including tenant interviews, appraisals, engineering studies, soil tests, environmental studies and underwriting analyses, as Buyer deems necessary or advisable. Buyer shall have the right to conduct a Phase I
environmental site assessment, and, if necessary, a Phase II environmental site assessment (including soils borings, soil sampling and, if relevant, ground water testing, and invasive sampling of building materials with respect to the Property).
Buyers activities at the Property shall be conducted in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the occupancy of any tenant or its employees, licensees or invitees. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Seller (and
Sellers agents, advisors, partners, members, owners, officers and directors, as the case may be) harmless from and against any losses, damages, injuries, claims, or causes of action, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) arising from the presence on the Property of Buyer or Buyers agents or independent contractors, including without limitation, any physical damages or injuries to people or property and any mechanics or materialmens
liens asserted against the Property by any party performing services or providing materials on behalf of Buyer or its agents or contractors, excluding, however, any costs, liabilities or damages attributable to Sellers gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall in no event be responsible for any liabilities or conditions existing at the Property which might cause expenses, claims or causes of action against Seller which are discovered on the
Property during any such inspection or investigation. The provisions of this Section shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement for any reason. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either party prior to Closing for any
reason, Buyer shall promptly provide Seller with copies of any such reports or studies Buyer has obtained.  3.2 Due
Diligence Period. Buyer shall have forty-five (45) days from the later of (i) the delivery of all of the Property Information (defined in Section 3.3 below) and (ii) the Effective Date of this Agreement (the Due
Diligence Period) to physically inspect the Property, review the economic data, underwrite the tenants and review the Leases, conduct appraisals, perform examinations of the physical condition of the Improvements, examine the Property for the
presence of Hazardous Materials (as defined below), and to otherwise conduct such due diligence review of the Property and all of the items to be furnished by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3 below, and all records and other materials
related thereto as Buyer deems appropriate.   
5 


3.3 Items to be Provided by Seller. No later than one (1) Business Day after the
Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer accurate and complete copies (in electronic and paper form) of all of the information set forth on Exhibit G attached hereto and incorporated herein (Property Information).
In addition to the foregoing deliveries, Seller shall make available to Buyer at Sellers office in Lindsay, Oklahoma for inspection and copying the originals of any other documents, instruments, studies, reports, surveys, maps, files,
correspondence (including without limitation, tenant correspondence files), reports and other materials related to the Property and not included in the Property Information to the extent the same are in Sellers possession or control. Seller
agrees to update, provide and make available to Buyer new Property Information as it becomes available. Where audited financial statements are required, to the extent Seller does not have audited financial statements, Buyer shall have the right (but
not the obligation), at its sole cost and expense, to have its auditor conduct an audit of the property financial statements and other information. Where financial statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principals (GAAP), to the extent Seller does not have such financial statements, Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation), at its sole cost and expense, to have its accountants prepare Sellers financial statements in
accordance with GAAP. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either party prior to Closing for any reason, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller copies of any items provided by Seller to Buyer. 
3.4 Termination of Property Contracts. Prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall notify Seller of any
Property Contract which Buyer wishes to retain and assume as of the Closing. Unless otherwise expressly agreed to by Buyer, all Property Contracts, including without limitation all property management agreements and leasing agreements, shall be
terminated by Seller, at Sellers expense, as of the Closing Date.  3.5 Buyers Possible Early Termination.
Buyer shall have the right to approve in Buyers sole and absolute discretion, the Property, the Property Information, the Preliminary Report, any Supplemental Report, the Survey, the UCC Searches, or any other matter whatsoever regarding the
Property. On or before the last day of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer may provide written notice (Approval Notice) to Seller and Escrow Holder that Buyer has approved the Property. At any time prior to the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period, Buyer may provide written notice to Seller and Escrow Holder disapproving the Property (Disapproval Notice). Upon the giving of a Disapproval Notice this Agreement shall automatically terminate and the provisions of
Section 3.6 shall apply. Unless Buyer provides to Seller a Disapproval Notice on or before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved the Property, and in such event (or if Buyer provides an Approval
Notice), Buyer shall have waived its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section.  3.6 Consequences of
Buyers Early Termination. Upon the giving of a Disapproval Notice or upon Buyers timely termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.2, this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and the parties shall be released from
all further obligations under this Agreement (except with respect to any provisions that by their terms survive a termination of this Agreement); provided, however, that if Seller is in default hereunder at the time of such termination,
Section 6.2 shall additionally apply. Escrow Holder shall pay the entire Deposit to Buyer not later than one (1) Business Day following receipt of Buyers Disapproval Notice (as long as the then-current investment of the Deposit can
be liquidated in   
6 



one (1) Business Day). No notice to Escrow Holder from Seller shall be required for the release of the Deposit to Buyer by Escrow Holder under this Section, and the Deposit shall be released
and delivered to Buyer upon Escrow Holders receipt of Buyers Disapproval Notice despite any objection or potential objection by Seller. 
ARTICLE 4

4.1 Sellers Representations. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.1, Seller warrants and represents to Buyer as follows:
 4.1.1 Seller is comprised of two duly formed and validly existing limited liability companies each of which is
organized under the laws of Oklahoma. Seller has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
all documents contemplated hereby by Seller have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller and all required consents and approvals have been duly obtained and will not result in a breach of any of the terms or
provisions of, or constitute a default under any indenture, agreement or instrument to which Seller is a party. This Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to
the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. 
4.1.2 Seller has fee simple title to the Property. To Sellers knowledge (i) there are no unrecorded or
undisclosed documents or other matters which affect title to the Property, and (ii) subject to the Leases, Seller has enjoyed the continuous and uninterrupted quiet possession, use and operation of the Property, without material complaint or
objection by any person.  4.1.3 Seller is not a foreign person within the meaning of
Section 1445(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).  4.1.4 Neither
Seller nor any of its affiliates, nor any of their respective partners, members, shareholders or other equity owners, and none of their respective employees, officers, directors, representatives or agents is, nor will they become, a person or entity
with whom United States persons or entities are restricted from doing business under regulations of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury (including those named on OFACs Specially Designated
and Blocked Persons List) or under any statute, executive order (including, without limitation, the September 24, 2001, Executive Order Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support
Terrorism), or other governmental action, and is not and will not engage in any dealings or transactions or be otherwise associated with such persons or entities. 
4.1.5 No authorization, consent, or approval of any governmental authority (including courts) is required for the
execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement or the performance of its obligations hereunder.   
7 


4.1.6 There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to
Sellers knowledge, threatened (a) affecting Seller, which if determined adversely, would affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder; or (b) against any portion of the Property. 
4.1.7 Seller has not (a) made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (b) filed any voluntary
petition in bankruptcy or suffered the filing of an involuntary petition by Sellers creditors, (c) suffered the appointment of a receiver to take possession of all or substantially all of Sellers assets, (d) suffered the
attachment or other judicial seizure of all, or substantially all, of Sellers assets, (e) admitted in writing its inability to pay its debts as they come due, or (f) made an offer of settlement, extension or composition to its
creditors generally.  4.1.8 Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement nor compliance
herewith (a) conflicts or will conflict with or results or will result in a breach of or constitutes or will constitute a default under (i) the respective articles of organization or operating agreement of Seller, or (ii) to
Sellers knowledge, any law or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority, or (b) to Sellers knowledge, results in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon its property
pursuant to any such agreement or instrument.  4.1.9 Seller has not entered into any material commitments or
agreements with any governmental authorities or agencies affecting the Property except as provided in the Property Information. 
4.1.10 There is no pending, and to Sellers knowledge there are no threatened or contemplated condemnation
proceedings relating to the Property, and Seller has received no written notice from any governmental agency or official to the effect that any such proceeding is contemplated. 
4.1.11 Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer complete copies of all Leases and other occupancy agreements
affecting the Property. The rent rolls provided to Buyer are the same used in the regular course of Sellers business. To Sellers knowledge, all the Leases are in full force and effect. Seller is landlord or lessor
under and is entitled to assign to Buyer, without tenants consent, each of the Leases at Closing. To Sellers knowledge, neither Seller nor any tenant is in default under the Leases, and to Sellers knowledge, there exists no
condition or circumstance or written notice of any condition or circumstance which, with the passage of time, would constitute a default of either Seller or any tenant. To Sellers knowledge, no tenant is asserting any claim of offset or other
defense in respect of its or Sellers obligations under the Leases, and there are no unresolved disputes relating to the calculation of additional rent under the Leases. To Sellers knowledge, there are no pending or incomplete tenant
improvements and unpaid tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions with respect to the Leases and no pecuniary obligation to tenants and brokers has vested or accrued and is owed by Seller, except that shall be fully completed and paid in full
prior to Closing.  4.1.12 The financial statements of Property operations provided by Seller, including, but
not limited to, statements of revenue and expenses, balance sheets and statements of cash flow and any year-to-date statements of revenue and expenses for the Property operations (updated quarterly) are true, correct and complete in all material
respects. Such financial   
8

credited, debited and adjusted between Seller and Buyer as of 12:01 a.m. on the day of the Closing (except as otherwise provided) in accordance with this section. For purposes of calculating prorations, Buyer shall be deemed to be in title to the
Property, and therefore entitled to the income and responsible for the expenses, for the entire day upon which the Closing occurs. 
(a) Current Rents. Tenant rents, including payments for taxes, utilities, common area maintenance, operating
expenses, or insurance, or additional charges of any other nature (collectively CAM), based on a rental statement prepared by Seller and reasonably approved by Buyer (which statement must be consistent with the final Rent Rolls). 
 (b) CAM; Impounds; Reconciliation. The provisions of this subparagraph (b) shall apply in
furtherance of the proration of tenant rents with respect to CAM under subparagraph (a) above:  (i) Where
any Lease provides for the payment of any CAM in arrears after being billed therefor by Seller, Seller shall be responsible for billing all unpaid 
 
18 



CAM charges under such Lease for all collection periods ending prior to the Closing, and shall be further responsible for providing to Buyer, no later than thirty (30) days after the
Closing, a final determination of any CAM owed by such tenant for the period prior to the date of Closing, together with all relevant back-up, paid invoices, receipts, and other materials. The collection and remitting of any CAM unpaid as of the
Closing shall be governed by the provisions of subparagraph (c) below regarding the post-closing collection of Unpaid Rents. 
(ii) Where Seller has collected any portion of CAM on an estimated basis, pursuant to so-called impounds, or
otherwise in advance, then the remaining provisions of this subparagraph (b) shall apply. If Sellers collection of such amounts is in excess of the amounts actually paid by Seller for the items comprising CAM for the period prior to
Closing, then Buyer shall receive a credit at Closing for the excess amounts collected. Buyer shall apply all such excess amounts to the charges owed by Buyer for such items for the period after the Closing and, if required by the Leases, shall
rebate or credit the tenants with any remainder. If it is determined that the amount collected during Sellers ownership period was less than the amounts actually paid by Seller for such items for the period prior to the Closing, then the
collection and remitting of such amounts shall be governed by the provisions of subparagraph (c) below regarding the post-closing collection of Unpaid Rents. 
(iii) Prior to Closing, Seller shall prepare for Buyers reasonable approval an estimated proration statement
reconciling the amounts paid by tenants in respect of CAM and the amounts actually paid by Seller therefor. Such statement shall set forth the parties estimate of the Buyers closing credit (if any), or of the amount to which Seller might
be entitled with respect to its period of ownership (if any). If any of the aforesaid prorations cannot be definitely calculated accurately as of the Closing, then they shall be recalculated as soon as practicable after the Closing. No later than
thirty (30) days after the end of the lease year for the Leases, Seller shall conduct a final reconciliation of any such overpayment or underpayment under the Leases to the date of Closing and shall provide such final reconciliation to Buyer,
together with all relevant back-up, paid invoices, receipts, and other materials; and if such final reconciliation indicates that Buyer was entitled to a larger credit with respect to the same than Buyer received at Closing, Seller shall immediately
remit the shortfall to Buyer. If such final reconciliation indicates that Buyer was entitled to a lesser credit with respect to the same than Buyer received at Closing, Buyer shall immediately return the excess to Seller. 
(iv) Seller shall be responsible for conducting and completing all reconciliations of CAM charges versus any collections
or impound therefor, and for billing all unpaid CAM charges, to tenants for all lease years prior to the Closing pursuant to the terms of the Leases. The collection and remitting of any CAM unpaid as of the Closing shall be governed by the
provisions of subparagraph (c) below regarding the post-closing collection of Unpaid Rents.  (c) Unpaid
Rents. As used herein, the term Unpaid Rents means any tenant rentals and other sums (however denominated and including without limitation unpaid CAM) owed to Seller from any tenant for more than thirty (30) days and not paid as
of the Closing Date. Seller hereby assigns to Buyer without warranty any and all Unpaid Rents. Seller specifically acknowledges and agrees that Buyer shall have the right to compromise, forgive or otherwise deal with Unpaid Rents in respect of the
tenant owing the same, which dealing may   
19 



result in economic advantage to Buyer, all without liability or obligation to Seller; provided, however, that if any Unpaid Rents are not otherwise forgiven, compromised or dealt with, such
Unpaid Rent, if and when collected by Buyer, shall be applied first to any unpaid rent and other sums owed to Buyer from such tenant accruing after the Closing through the date of collection, with any remaining amounts allocable to the period prior
to Closing being paid to Seller (after deduction of all collection costs including attorneys fees). Without limiting the foregoing, Seller specifically agrees not to undertake any effort to collect unpaid rent or other sums (however

5.11 Possession and Tenant Notices. Possession of the Property shall be delivered to Buyer by Seller at the Closing, subject only
to the rights of tenants under the Leases, rights arising under any Property Contracts not terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 3.4 above, and rights arising under the matters set forth in the Preliminary Report and permitted as part of the
Required Title Condition. Seller and Buyer covenant and agree to execute at Closing a written notice of the acquisition of the Property by Buyer, in sufficient copies for transmittal to all tenants affected by the sale and purchase of the Property
and properly addressed to all such tenants. Such notice shall be prepared by Buyer, at Buyers cost and expense, and approved by Seller, shall notify the tenants of the sale and transfer and shall contain appropriate instructions relating to
the payment of future rentals, the giving of future notices and other matters reasonably required by Buyer or required by law. Unless a different procedure is required by applicable law, in which event such laws shall be controlling, Buyer agrees to
transmit or otherwise deliver such letters to the tenants promptly after the Closing.  ARTICLE 6 
TERMINATION AND DEFAULT 
6.1 Buyer Default. If prior to Closing, Buyer fails to perform any of its obligations or is otherwise in default hereunder, or if
the sale contemplated hereby is not consummated because of a default by Buyer, Seller shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy, to terminate this Agreement and have the Deposit paid to and retained by Seller as liquidated damages. In
such event Seller and Buyer shall have no further obligations to each other except those which survive the termination of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the damages to Seller in the event of a breach of this Agreement by Buyer
would be difficult or impossible to determine, that the amount of the deposit plus interest represents the parties best and most accurate estimate of the damages that would be suffered by Seller if the transaction should fail to close and that
such estimate is reasonable under the circumstances existing as of the date of this Agreement and under the circumstances that Seller and Buyer reasonably anticipate would exist at the time of such breach. Buyer and Seller agree that Sellers
right to retain the Deposit together with any interest and earnings earned thereon shall be Sellers sole remedy, at law and in equity, for Buyers failure to purchase the Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Seller
hereby waives any right to an action for specific performance of any provisions of this Agreement.  6.2 Sellers
Default. If prior to Closing Seller fails to perform any of its obligations or is otherwise in default hereunder, Buyer, as its sole and exclusive remedies, shall have the right to exercise any or all of the following: 
6.2.1 Institute an action for specific performance to cause Seller to convey the Property to Buyer pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, within sixty (60) days of the proposed Closing Date.   
22 


6.2.2 Terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller and Escrow Holder to that
effect, to recover the full amount of the Deposit and all earnings thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the foregoing remedies and Seller shall not be deemed to be in default hereunder for a false representation contained herein, nor have any liability to any Buyers Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 4.5.1,
if Buyer has actual knowledge that such representation was false when made by Seller, or if Buyer learns prior to Closing of the falsity of such representation and nevertheless proceeds to the Closing, which in each instance shall constitute a
waiver of Buyers remedies hereunder. Buyer shall be deemed to have notice for purposes of the above limitation if any one of Buyers notice parties set forth in Section 9.7 below shall have notice of such item. 
ARTICLE 7 
CASUALTY DAMAGE OR CONDEMNATION 
7.1 Casualty. If the Improvements are damaged by casualty prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have the sole option to elect either
to:  (a) acquire the Property as is (without reduction in the Purchase Price), plus an assignment without
recourse or credit of any insurance proceeds payable by virtue of such loss or damage plus a credit for any deductible or uninsured loss under said policy; or 
(b) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit. 
Such right must be exercised within ninety (90) days from the date Seller provides Buyer with notice of the loss of
the event giving rise to such right. If Buyer fails to provide notice of an election, then Buyer shall have been deemed to elect (b) above. 
7.2 Condemnation. In the event that any portion of the Property should be condemned prior to the Closing, at Buyers sole
option, elect either to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit; or 
(b) close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 
In all other cases, or if Buyer elects to proceed under Section 7.2(b), Buyer shall purchase the Property in
accordance with the terms hereof (without reduction in the Purchase Price) and Seller shall assign to Buyer at Closing all condemnation proceeds payable as a result of such condemnation. Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to proceed under
Section 7.2(a) unless, within ninety (90) days from written notice of the condemnation, Buyer provides Seller with written notice that Buyer elects to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.2(b).   
23 


ARTICLE 8 
REAL ESTATE COMMISSION 
8.1 Commissions. Buyer and Seller each represent to the other that no brokers or real estate commissions or other fees,
other than the brokers commission payable to The Silver Group by Seller, are or shall be due in respect to this transaction by reason of any agreement made or which may be alleged to have been made by Buyer or Seller. Each party agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the other from and against any and all claims, demands or the cost or expense thereof, including reasonable attorneys fees, arising out of any brokers commission, fee or other compensation due or alleged to be
due in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon an agreement alleged to have been made or other action alleged to have been taken by the indemnifying party.

only be effective if evidenced by a written statement signed by the party so excusing or waiving. No delay in exercising any right or remedy shall constitute a waiver thereof, and no waiver by Seller or Buyer of the breach of any covenant of this
Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other covenant or condition of this Agreement. 
9.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the internal laws of the State of Texas, without regard

other than Saturday, Sunday and any day which is a legal holiday in the State of Texas.  9.15 Construction of
Agreement. This Agreement shall not be construed more strictly against one party than against the other merely by virtue of the fact that it may have been prepared primarily by counsel for one of the parties, it being recognized that both Buyer
and Seller have contributed substantially and materially to the preparation of this Agreement.  9.16 Severability. The
parties hereto intend and believe that each provision in this Agreement comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions. However, if any provision in this Agreement is found by a court of law to be in violation of
any applicable local, state or federal law, statute, ordinance, administrative or judicial decision, or public policy, or if in any other respect such a court declares any such provision to be illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as
written, then it is the intent of all parties hereto that, consistent with and with a view towards preserving the economic and legal arrangements among the parties hereto as expressed in this Agreement, such provision shall be given force and effect
to the fullest possible extent, and that the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable provision were not contained herein, and that the rights, obligations and interests of the
parties under the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  9.17 Exclusivity. After the
Effective Date, Seller and its respective agents, representatives and employees shall immediately cease all marketing of the Property until such time as this Agreement is terminated and Seller shall not directly or indirectly make, accept,
negotiate, entertain or otherwise pursue any offers for the sale of the Property.  9.18 Section 1031 Exchange.
Either party may consummate the purchase or sale of the Property as part of a so-called like kind exchange (an Exchange) pursuant to section 1031 of the Code, provided that (i) the Closing shall not be delayed or affected by
reason of an Exchange nor shall the consummation or accomplishment of any Exchange be a condition precedent or condition subsequent to a partys obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any party desiring an Exchange shall effect its
Exchange through an assignment of this Agreement, or its rights under this Agreement, to a qualified intermediary and the other party shall not be required to take an assignment of the purchase agreement for the relinquished or replacement property
or be required to acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes of consummating such Exchange; and (iii) the party desiring an Exchange shall pay any additional costs that would not otherwise have been incurred by Buyer or Seller had
such party not consummated its purchase or sale through an Exchange. Neither party shall by this agreement or acquiescence to an Exchange desired by the other party (1) have its rights under this Agreement affected or diminished in any manner
or (2) be responsible for compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to the other party that such partys Exchange in fact complies with section 1031 of the Code. In connection with such cooperation, Seller agrees, upon request of
Buyer to direct deed for actual interests in the property to designees of Buyer.

FIRST AMENDMENT TO REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this First Amendment) is entered into as of this 11th
day of May, 2010, by and between Rocky Bluff, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited liability company and Standridge & Jackson Development, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited liability company (collectively, Seller) and BC
Development Co., LLC, a Missouri limited liability company, its successors and assigns (Buyer). 
RECITALS 
A. Seller and Buyer entered into that certain Real Estate Purchase Agreement dated April 15, 2010 (the Original
Agreement) pursuant to which Seller agreed to sell, and Buyer agreed to purchase, certain parcels of real property and more particularly described in the Original Agreement. 
B. Seller and Buyer desire to amend the Original Agreement as set forth herein. 
AGREEMENT 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:  1. Purchase
Price. Section 1.3 of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 
1.3 Purchase Price. 
1.3.1 The purchase price for the Property (the Purchase Price) shall collectively be Fifteen Million Three
Hundred Thousand and 00/100s Dollars ($15,300,000.00), and shall be allocated as set forth on Schedule 1.3 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller by Buyer on the Closing Date (as
defined below), plus or minus all adjustments or credits as set forth herein, by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds. 
1.3.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price was determined based on a projected
aggregate NOI (as defined below) of One Million Two Hundred Sixty Two Thousand Three Hundred Ninety Six and no/100 Dollars ($1,262,396.00) for the first full year of the term of each of the Leases, and thus a capitalization rate of 8.25%
(Capitalization Rate). For purposes of this Agreement, NOI shall mean gross rent income received less (i) all tax deductible operating expenses, (ii) any additional cash outflows, (iii) all repair costs and
(iv) the amortized cost of any capital improvements needed over the remaining term of each Lease. If as of the 



Effective Date the NOI for the first year of the term of any Lease has not been established (such Lease being an, Unmatured Lease), Buyer and Seller agree to adjust the allocated
Purchase Price attributable to the parcel subject to such Unmatured Lease in the event that the first-year NOI that is allocated for such parcel differs from the projected NOI as set forth on Schedule 1.3 attached hereto and incorporated
herein by reference by a margin greater than three percent (3%). Such adjusted allocated Purchase Price shall be computed by dividing the established NOI for the Unmatured Lease by the Capitalization Rate. To the extent the NOI for any Unmatured
Lease is established on or before the Closing Date, any applicable adjustment to the allocated Purchase Price for the parcel subject to such Unmatured Lease based on the foregoing shall be effected at Closing. To the extent the NOI for any Unmatured
Lease is not established on or before the Closing Date, then any adjustment to the Purchase Price based on the foregoing, whether in favor of the Buyer or the Seller, shall be made after all of the Unmatured Leases have had their respective
NOI properly established and the party entitled to such adjustment shall be paid the difference between the allocated Purchase Price and the allocated Purchase Price as adjusted, by immediately available federal funds within twenty (20) days
after notice of the same by Buyer or Seller.  1.3.3 In addition to adjustment to the Purchase Price set forth
in Section 1.3.2 above, Seller and Buyer agree to further adjust the Purchase Price in the event that the base year (as defined in the respective Lease) for the property taxes levied against any parcel (the Property
Taxes) has not been established as of the Effective Date. Any adjustment to the Purchase Price based on the foregoing, whether in favor of Buyer or Seller, shall be made after the base year Property Taxes have been established in accordance
with the applicable Lease, and the party entitled to such adjustment shall be credited or paid the quotient of (a) the net difference between (i) the actual Property Taxes for the base year and (ii) the currently
estimated amount of the Property Taxes for the base year, as set forth in the Lease and included on Schedule 1.3 attached hereto and incorporated by reference divided by (b) the Capitalization Rate. If the base year Property Taxes
are established under any Lease after the Effective Date but on or before the Closing Date, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided herein on the Closing Date. If the base year Property Taxes are established under any Lease after the
Closing Date, then an amount equal to any applicable Purchase Price adjustment shall be paid to the party entitled thereto in immediately available federal funds within twenty (20) days after notice of the same by Buyer or Seller (as
applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.3.3, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the NOI figures set forth in Schedule 1.3 for each parcel were computed by including the presently
estimated base year Property Taxes among the operating expenses that   
2 



were deducted from gross rent income, and (b) accordingly, any adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 1.3.3 shall be computed in a manner that will not result in the
duplication of any adjustment to the Purchase Price that is effected pursuant to Section 1.3.2 with reference to NOI figures that include expenses for Property Taxes which differ from the amounts shown in Schedule 1.3. 
2. Schedule 1.3. Schedule 1.3 of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with Schedule
1.3 attached hereto.  3. Closing Date. Section 1.5.1 of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety and replaced with the following:  1.5.1 The closing (Closing, sometimes referred to herein
as the Close of Escrow) means the date Escrow Holder disburses funds in accordance with this Agreement and is irrevocably committed to record the Deed (defined below in Section 5.6.1) in favor of Buyer and shall take place through
an escrow opened with Escrow Holder on or before August 6, 2010 (the Closing Date), or upon such earlier date as Buyer may elect upon five (5) Business Days notice to Seller. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to
the contrary, in no event shall the Closing occur earlier than one hundred five (105) days after the Effective Date, unless Buyer shall have expressly waived this contingency in a separately executed written document. 
4. Due Diligence Period. Section 3.2 of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the
following:  3.2 Due Diligence Period. Buyer shall have from the Effective Date until June 11, 2010
(the Due Diligence Period) to physically inspect the Property, review the economic data, underwrite the tenants and review the Leases, conduct appraisals, perform examinations of the physical condition of the Improvements, examine the
Property for the presence of Hazardous Materials (as defined below), and to otherwise conduct such due diligence review of the Property and all of the items to be furnished by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3 below, and all records and
other materials related thereto as Buyer deems appropriate.  5. Entire Agreement. The Original Agreement, as modified
by this First Amendment, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated therein. Except as modified by this First Amendment, the Original Agreement remains unchanged and unmodified and in
full force and effect, and the parties hereto hereby ratify and affirm the same.

6. Counterparts. This First Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts
and it shall be sufficient that the signature of each party appear on one or more such counterparts. All counterparts shall collectively constitute a single agreement. Signatures to this First Amendment transmitted by facsimile or electronic mail
shall be treated as originals in all respects.  [Remainder of page intentionally left blank; signatures appear on following
