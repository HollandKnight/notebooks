2.1 Title and Survey. Buyer may, at its option and expense, (i) obtain a preliminary title

at its sole cost and expense, to satisfy at or prior to Closing all monetary encumbrances affecting
the Property that are evidenced by deeds of trust, tax liens, judgments, mechanics liens, or other
liens or charges in a fixed sum (each a Monetary Encumbrance), and Seller authorizes the use of
the Purchase Price or a portion thereof to pay and discharge the same at Closing. If Buyer does

Preliminary Report of which Buyer receives actual notice after the expiration of the Due Diligence
Period, and (iii) any matter Seller shall have expressly undertaken to satisfy on or before
Closing, if any.


ARTICLE 3
INSPECTION AND DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD
3.1 Access. From and after the Effective Date through the Closing, (a) Buyer, personally
or through its authorized agent or representatives, shall be entitled, upon reasonable advance
notice to Seller to allow Seller the opportunity to have a representative present, and subject to
the rights of tenants under the Tenant Leases, to enter upon the Property during normal business
hours and shall have the right to make such investigations, including appraisals, tenant interviews
(but Seller may be present or on the phone for such interviews), interviews of government
officials, engineering studies, soil tests, environmental studies and underwriting analyses, as
Buyer deems necessary or advisable, and (b) Seller shall, at Sellers expense, turn on, run, and
maintain, consistent with existing practice, electrical power and all utilities to the Property
(including without limitation plumbing, heating and air conditioning systems) to facilitate Buyers
testing and investigations thereof. Buyer shall have the right to conduct a Phase I environmental
site assessment, and, with Sellers consent, which shall be in Sellers sole discretion, a Phase II
environmental site assessment (including soils borings, soil sampling and, if relevant, ground
water testing, and invasive sampling of building materials with respect to the Property). Before
beginning any of its investigations of the Property, Buyer will obtain liability insurance in the
minimum amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) naming Seller as an additional insured.
Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Seller (and Sellers agents, advisors, partners, members,
owners, officers and directors, as the case may be) harmless from any physical damages arising out
of all inspections and investigations by Buyer or its agents or independent contractors, but in no
event shall the indemnity of this Section include the discovery of pre-existing conditions
disclosed by Buyers investigations. Buyer shall return the Property to its pre-existing condition
after its tests of the Property, normal wear and tear excepted. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, this indemnification shall survive the termination of
or Closing under this Agreement. Buyer shall keep confidential the results of its tests and
investigations and not reveal the results to any third parties, except as required by applicable
law and except to its partners, prospective lenders, prospective equity providers, agents, and
applicable representatives of each, provided that each is advised of the confidential nature of the
material.


3.2 Due Diligence Period. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1 above, the period from
the Effective Date until the Closing Date (as the same may be extended pursuant to Section 1.5.1
above) shall be the Due Diligence Period. In no event shall the Due Diligence extend beyond a
date that is forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date. During the Due Diligence Period, the
Buyer shall physically inspect the Property, review the economic data, conduct appraisals, perform
examinations of the physical condition of the Improvements, examine the Property for the presence
of Hazardous Materials (as defined below), and to otherwise conduct such due diligence review of
the Property and all of the items to be furnished by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3 below,
and all records and other materials related thereto as Buyer deems appropriate.


3.3 Items to be Provided by Seller. Except for those items listed on Schedule 3.3, Seller
has delivered to Buyer accurate and complete copies of all of the information set forth on Exhibit
B but only to the extent any such information is in Sellers actual possession or control, and
without warranty as to the accuracy thereof except as expressly set forth in this Agreement
(collectively, the Property Information). To the extent such information is in Sellers actual
possession, Seller shall provide the items listed on Schedule 3.3 within three (3) Business Days
after the Effective Date.


3.4 Property Contracts. Buyer shall not be required to assume any Contracts at Closing.
As of the Closing Date, Seller, at Buyers expense, shall terminate any Contracts that Buyer does
not accept in Buyers sole discretion by written notification to Seller prior to the expiration of
the Due Diligence Period, provided however, that, Buyer shall never be deemed to have elected to
assume any leasing commission agreements or management agreements applicable to the Property, and
Seller, as of the Closing Date, shall terminate any leasing commission agreements and management
agreements applicable to the Property at Sellers expense. Any Contract that requires a
termination fee to be paid is set forth on Schedule 3.4 attached hereto.


3.5 Buyers Possible Early Termination. Buyer shall have the right to approve or
disapprove in Buyers sole and absolute discretion, the Property, the Property Information, or any
other matter whatsoever regarding the Property. At any time prior to or on the expiration of the
Due Diligence Period, Buyer may provide written notice to Seller disapproving the Property for
purposes of this Article 3 (Disapproval Notice). Unless Buyer provides Seller with a written
notice of its approval of the Property (Approval Notice) prior to or on the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and the provisions of Section 3.6
shall apply. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Approval Notice shall not be
deemed to be a waiver by Buyer of any other rights of termination it may have as set forth herein.


3.6 Consequences of Buyers Early Termination. Unless Buyer provides an Approval Notice to
Seller pursuant to Section 3.5, this Agreement shall immediately terminate upon the expiration of
the Due Diligence Period, and the parties shall be released from all further obligations under this
Agreement (except with respect to any provisions that by their terms survive a termination of this
Agreement); provided, however, that if Seller is willfully in material default hereunder for a
matter under Sellers reasonable control or if a representation of Seller made in this Agreement
was knowingly false when made and not cured by Seller as provided in Section 5.4, and Buyer
demonstrates that it would have purchased the Property but for the facts underlying the false
representation, then at the time of such termination, Section 6.2 shall additionally apply (as to
Buyers actually incurred out-of-pocket expenses). Escrow Agent shall pay the entire Deposit to
Buyer not later than one (1) Business Day following termination of this Agreement. No notice to
Escrow Agent from Seller shall be required for the release of the Deposit to Buyer by Escrow Agent
under this Section, and the Deposit shall be released and delivered to Buyer upon Escrow Agents
receipt of Buyers confirmation of termination of the Agreement pursuant to this Article 3, despite
any objection or potential objection by Seller. If Buyer delivers an Approval Notice, the Deposit
shall be deemed non-refundable to Buyer, except as set forth herein.

4.1.15 Reserved.


4.1.16 Seller has not received any written notice from, and is otherwise aware of no grounds

been no further complaints, since at least August of 2008. Except as set forth above, Seller has
not received written notice from any governmental authority that there are Hazardous Materials
stored on, incorporated into, located on, present in or used on the Property in violation of, and
requiring remediation under, any laws, ordinances, statutes, codes, rules or regulations as of the
date of this Agreement or, upon the Close of Escrow hereunder, in existence on the Close of Escrow.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term Hazardous Materials shall mean any substance which is
or contains: (i) any hazardous substance as now defined in Section 101(14) of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (42 U.S.C. Section 9601
et seq.) (CERCLA) or any regulations promulgated under CERCLA; (ii) any hazardous waste as now
defined the Recourse Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq.) (RCRA) or
regulations promulgated under RCRA; (iii) any substance regulated by the Toxic Substances Control
Act (15 U.S.C. Section 2601 et. seq.); (iv) gasoline, diesel fuel or other petroleum
hydrocarbons; (v) asbestos and asbestos containing materials, in any form, whether friable or
non-friable; (vi) polychlorinated biphenyls; (vii) radon gas. Seller has received no written
notice that the Property or any portion thereof contains any form of toxic mold, as it is Sellers
understanding that the moisture issues disclosed above did not constitute toxic mold. No
treatment has been undertaken by Seller with respect to termite infestation on the Property other
than normal periodic service, and to Sellers knowledge there is no damage to any portion of the
Property from termite infestation.


4.1.21 There are no claims pending or unpaid bills which would result in the creation of any
lien on the Property for any improvements completed or in progress, including, but not limited to,

material purchased in connection with the Property which will not be paid by or at the Close of
Escrow or placed in escrow pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

policy of insurance covering the Property requesting the performance of any work with respect to
the Property or the Improvements located thereon which has not been fully complied with.

from any agency, board, commission, bureau or other instrumentality of any government, whether
federal, state or local, that, Seller is not in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable statutes, rules, regulations and requirements of all federal, state and local
commissions, boards, bureaus and agencies having jurisdiction over Seller and the Land and
Improvements. To Sellers knowledge, Seller, with respect to the Property, has timely filed all
reports, data and other information required to be filed with such commissions, boards, bureaus and
agencies where a failure to file timely would have a material adverse effect on the transactions
contemplated hereby or the intended operation of the Land and Improvements.


4.1.24 Seller shall immediately notify Buyer, in writing, of any event or condition known to
Seller which occurs prior to the Close of Escrow hereunder, which causes a change in the facts
relating to, or the truth of, any of the representations or warranties.


4.1.25 All information given by Seller to Buyer in this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder shall be true and accurate in every material respect as of the
date hereof and at the Close of Escrow, provided that if a warranty or representation becomes
untrue between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, the same will not be considered a default
by Seller hereunder, unless Seller shall have breached its obligations set forth in Section 4.5.7
below. Seller shall promptly inform Buyer in writing if Seller becomes aware of any (i) material
adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Property, or the operation thereof,
at any time prior to the Close of Escrow or (ii) if any information, document, agreement or other
material delivered to Buyer is materially amended, superseded, modified or supplemented.


4.1.26 Alan W. McKinney and Mark Kury (collectively, Sellers Knowledge Parties) are the
individuals who are most knowledgeable about the Property.


As used herein, to Sellers knowledge or similar phrases shall mean the actual present and
conscious awareness or knowledge of the Sellers Knowledge Parties without any duty of inquiry or
investigation; provided that so qualifying Sellers knowledge shall in no event give rise to any
personal liability on the part of any of the Sellers Knowledge Parties on account of any breach of
any representation or warranty made by Seller herein. Said terms do not include constructive
knowledge, imputed knowledge, or knowledge Seller or such persons do not have but could have
obtained through further investigation or inquiry. No broker, agent, or party other than the
Seller is authorized to make any representation or warranty for or on behalf of Seller. Seller has
not read all of the Property Information and makes no representation or warranty as to the truth,
accuracy or completeness thereof.


4.2 Buyers Representations. Buyer makes the following representations and warranties to
Seller that, to the best of Buyers knowledge:


4.2.1 Buyer is a duly formed and validly existing limited liability company in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware.


4.2.2 Buyer has full right, power and authority and is duly authorized to enter into this
Agreement and to perform each of these covenants on it part to be performed hereunder and to
execute and deliver and to perform its obligations under all documents required to be executed and
delivered by it pursuant to this Agreement and this Agreement constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms.


4.3 Survivability of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of Seller and Buyer set forth in this Agreement are remade as of the Closing Date
(except for Sellers representation and warranty in Section 4.1.12 above) and shall not be deemed
to be merged into or waived by the instruments of Closing and shall survive for a period of nine
(9) months after the Closing Date (the Survival Period). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon
receipt by Seller of information not known to Seller as of the Effective Date, Seller may provide
written notice to Buyer modifying a representation or warranty made by Seller based on such
information; provided however, that for a period of five (5) business days after receipt of such
notice or by the Closing, as the case may be, Buyer shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement, and the provisions of Section 3.6 shall apply.  In the event that the modification of
the representation or warranty is necessary due to Sellers willful action or failure to perform
any obligation within Sellers reasonable control, the Buyer shall have a period of five (5)
business days after receipt of such notice or by the Closing, as the case may be, during which
Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, and the provisions of the provisions of
Section 6.2 shall apply. Each party shall have the right to bring an action against the other for
the breach of a representation or warranty hereunder, but only on the following conditions: (i) the
party bringing the action for breach first learns of the breach after Closing and files such action
within the Survival Period, (ii) the damage to such party on account of such breach (individually,
or when combined with damages from other breaches) equals or exceeds Ten Thousand Dollars
($10,000.00), and (iii) the party bringing the action did not have actual knowledge of the breach
as of Closing. Furthermore, Buyer and Seller agree that the aggregate maximum liability of the
other for the alleged breach of any or all representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement is limited to the actual damages incurred by Buyer or Seller (as applicable) as a direct
result of the breach of the other of any or all of the representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement, up to, but not to exceed Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00). In no
event shall either party be liable to the other for special, consequential, or punitive damages as
a result of a breach of any or all representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement. The
provisions of this Section 4.3 shall survive Closing.


4.4 Property Conveyed As Is. Except as may be expressly represented herein, in the
exhibits attached hereto and in the documents to be executed and delivered by Seller to Buyer at
Closing, Buyer agrees that the Property shall be sold, and Buyer shall accept possession of the
Property at Closing on an as-is-where-is with all faults basis. Buyer acknowledges that except
as expressly set forth herein and in the documents to be executed as part of the Closing, Seller
makes no representations whatsoever regarding the Property, Buyer represents to Seller that prior
to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall have independently examined, inspected
and investigated, to the full satisfaction of Buyer, all aspects of the Property.


4.5 Leasing & Other Activities Prior to Closing.


4.5.1 Leasing Activities. Seller shall not, after the end of the Due Diligence
Period, enter into any lease affecting the Property or any modification or amendment thereto, or
consent to any sublease under a lease, in each case, without the prior written consent of Buyer,
which may be given or withheld in Buyers sole discretion; provided that Seller may enter into the
amendment to the Smith, Patel and Amkieh, LLC Lease substantially on the terms previously disclosed
to Buyer without Buyers consent. Seller represents that except as set forth in Schedule 4.5.1
attached hereto no leasing commissions, rent concessions or tenant improvement allowances will be

shall copy Buyer on any and all correspondence received from or sent to tenants regarding the
Tenant Leases at the notice address below.


4.5.2 Service Contracts. Seller shall not, after the end of the Due Diligence Period,
enter into any new service contracts for the Property or modifications, renewals or terminations of
any existing Contracts, without the written consent of Buyer, which consent may be given or
withheld in Buyers sole discretion. Effective at Closing, Seller shall terminate, at Sellers
expense, any leasing commission agreements or management agreements applicable to the Property, and
Seller shall terminate, at Buyers expense any other service contract that Buyer does not elect to
assume as set forth in Section 3.4 above.


4.5.3 Conducting Business. At all times prior to Closing, Seller shall continue to
(i) conduct business with respect to the Property in substantially the same manner in which said
business has been heretofore conducted; provided that Seller shall not be obligated to perform
capital improvements at the Property, and (ii) insure the Property substantially as it is currently
insured and in any event in accordance with the requirements of any mortgage or deed of trust
affecting the Property.


4.5.4 Encumbrances. At all times prior to Closing, Seller shall not sell, mortgage,
pledge, encumber, hypothecate or otherwise transfer or dispose of all or any part of the Property
or any interest therein except for any encumbrance to be released at Closing without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which may be given or withheld in Buyers sole discretion; and Seller
shall not consent to, approve or otherwise take any action with respect to zoning or any other
governmental rules or regulations presently applicable to all or any part of the Property.


4.5.5 Monthly Operating Statements. Seller shall provide Buyer with a copy of the
monthly operating statement for the operation of the Property on or before the twenty (20) days
after the end of each month commencing with the month during which the Effective Date occurs, and
continuing for each full calendar month thereafter until the Closing Date.


4.5.6 Compliance with Laws and Regulations. At all times prior to Closing, Seller
shall not knowingly take any action that would result in a failure to comply in all material
respects with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and requirements of all federal, state
and local commissions, boards, bureaus and agencies applicable to the Real Property, it being
understood and agreed that prior to Closing, Seller will have the right to contest any of the same.


4.5.7 Compliance with Representations. Seller will not willfully take or cause to be
taken any action or fail to perform any obligation within Sellers reasonable control which would

Agreement, Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its officers, directors, partners,

Buyers Indemnified Parties) harmless from and against any and all liabilities, liens, claims,
damages, costs, expenses, suits or judgments paid or incurred by any of Buyers Indemnified Parties
and all expenses related thereto, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable
attorneys fees arising out of or in any way connected or related to any actions from third parties
(and not including claims from tenants) as to which Seller has insurance coverage in place. The

ARTICLE 5
CLOSING
5.1 Escrow Agent. The Closing shall occur through the Escrow opened at the Escrow Agent
named in Section 1.4. Escrow Agent is designated, authorized and instructed to act as Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.


5.2 Escrow Instructions; Opening of Escrow. This Agreement shall constitute initial escrow
instructions to Escrow Agent. The parties shall execute any additional escrow instructions
reasonably required by Escrow Agent to consummate the transaction provided for herein; provided,
however, such additional escrow instructions shall not modify the provisions of this Agreement,
unless such instructions (i) clearly identify the specific provisions being modified, (ii) state
the modification in full, and (ii) are signed by both parties. The parties shall open escrow by
delivering an executed copy of this Agreement executed by Buyer and Seller to Escrow Agent
(Opening of Escrow). Upon receipt of the Agreement, Escrow Agent shall acknowledge the Opening
of Escrow as described below and its agreement to act as the Escrow Agent hereunder by:
(a) executing the Consent of Escrow Agent attached hereto; and (b) delivering a copy of the
executed Consent to Seller and Buyer.


5.3 Closing. Close of Escrow or Closing means the date Escrow Agent records the Deed
in favor of Buyer. The Closing shall take place on the Closing Date set forth in Section 1.5.1, as
the same may be adjusted, provided all conditions to the Closing have been satisfied or duly
waived.


5.4 Conditions Precedent Favoring Buyer. In addition to any other conditions precedent in
favor of Buyer as may be expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyers obligations under
this Agreement are subject to the timely fulfillment of the conditions set forth in this
Section 5.4 on or before the Closing Date, or such earlier date as is set forth below. Each
condition may be waived in whole or in part only, by written notice of such waiver from Buyer to
Seller.


5.4.1 Seller performing and complying in all material respects with all of the terms of this
Agreement to be performed and complied with by Seller prior to or at the Closing.


5.4.2 No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall have
obtained estoppel certificates from tenants that in the aggregate lease at least eighty percent
(80%) of the leased square footage of the Improvements, which shall include an estoppel certificate
from any tenant occupying more than three thousand (3,000) rentable square feet of space in the
Property (each a Tenant Estoppel). Each estoppel certificate shall be in a form substantially
similar to Exhibit F attached hereto. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the date
upon which Seller intends to distribute the estoppel certificates to the tenants for their
completion, Seller shall deliver the draft estoppel certificates to Buyer for Buyers review and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such estoppel shall be consistent
with its respective Tenant Lease, shall not reveal any default by Seller, any right to offset rent
by the tenant, or any claim of the same, be dated no earlier than thirty (30) days prior to Closing
and shall be otherwise reasonably acceptable to Buyer.


5.4.3 Reserved.


5.4.4 On the Closing Date, all of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in
Section 4 hereof (except for Sellers representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.1.12)
shall be true, accurate and complete.


5.4.5 At Closing, the Title Company shall issue to Buyer an ALTA 2006 extended coverage
Owners Policy of Title Insurance (Title Policy) insuring Buyers fee simple title to the
Property for the sum equal to the Purchase Price conforming to the Required Title Condition set
forth in Section 2.2 above and containing such endorsements as Buyer shall have reasonably
required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall obtain a firm title commitment from the Title
Company, including the endorsements Buyer shall require, prior to the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period, such that Buyer shall be excused for non-performance under this Section 5.4.5
only upon the Title Companys refusal to issue the Title Policy agreed upon in the Due Diligence
Period. Buyer shall allow Seller five (5) business days to locate a reputable title agent and a
national title company mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller in their reasonable discretion to
issue the agreed upon title policy to Buyer at Closing. If Seller cannot satisfy this condition to
Closing through its own efforts, Buyer will be excused from its obligation to close and may
terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of the Deposit.


5.4.6 Seller shall have obtained a waiver of the right of first offer granted to Louisiana
Heart Hospital, LLC (LHH) on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer (the Waiver) and
delivered it to Buyer.


5.4.7 There shall have been no material adverse change in the physical condition of the
Property from the end of the Due Diligence Period through the Closing Date.


5.4.8 No tenant (i) has filed for bankruptcy or taken any similar debtor-protection measure,
(ii) is in default under its Tenant Lease, (iii) has discontinued operations at the Property, or
(iv) has given notice to Seller or Buyer of its intention to do any of the foregoing.


5.4.9 The lease amendment proposed to Smith, Patel and Amkieh, LLC as of the Effective Date
shall have been executed by and between Seller and said tenant.


The conditions set forth in this Section 5.4 are solely for the benefit of Buyer and may be
waived only by Buyer. At all times Buyer has the right to waive any condition by giving written
notice of such waiver to Seller and Escrow Agent. Such waiver or waivers must be in writing to
Seller. If Buyer notifies Seller of a failure to satisfy the conditions precedent set forth in this
Section 5.4, Seller may, within five (5) days after receipt of Buyers notice, agree to satisfy the
condition by written notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall thereupon be obligated to close the
transaction provided (a) Seller so satisfies such condition and (b) no such right to cure shall
extend the Close of Escrow. If there occurs a failure of a condition to Buyers obligation to
close before the expiration of the Due Diligence Date, Buyers sole remedy shall be to terminate
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there occurs a failure of a condition precedent
to Buyers obligation to close after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period but prior to the
Closing Date, and such failure is readily cured by a sum not greater than $25,000.00, as determined
by Seller in Sellers reasonable discretion, then Seller may escrow a portion of the Purchase Price
equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of such sum to fulfill the condition, otherwise
Buyer may elect as its sole remedy to terminate this Agreement as set forth herein. After Closing,
Seller shall have a reasonable period of time to draw upon such funds to fulfill the condition (no
longer a condition to Closing, but an obligation of Seller surviving Closing), and the balance of
such funds will be remitted to Seller upon completion. If Seller does not fulfill its obligation
hereunder within a reasonable time following Closing, Buyer may draw upon the escrowed funds to
perform Sellers obligation, the balance to be remitted to Seller upon completion. If Seller fails
to agree to cure or fails to cure such condition by the Close of Escrow, the Buyer shall be
entitled to the Deposit; provided, however, if such failure constitutes a breach or default of its
covenants, representations or warranties Seller shall remain liable for such breach or default as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement.


5.5 Conditions Precedent Favoring Seller. In addition to any other condition precedent in
favor of Seller as may be expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, Sellers obligations
under this Agreement are expressly subject to the timely fulfillment of the conditions set forth in
this Section 5.5 on or before the Closing Date, or such earlier date as is set forth below. Each
condition may be waived in whole or part only by written notice of such waiver from Seller to Buyer
and written acceptance of such waiver by Buyer.


5.5.1 Buyer performing and complying in all material respects with all of the terms of this
Agreement to be performed and complied with by Buyer prior to or at the Closing.


5.5.2 On the Closing Date, all of the representations of Buyer set forth in this Agreement

Tenant Leases; (iii) the Warranties and Permits; and (iv) any Contracts Buyer elects to assume in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.


5.6.3 Originals of all Tenant Leases (with all amendments and modifications thereto) relating
to the Property; provided however, that Seller shall provide copies, and not originals, of those

Internal Revenue Code.


5.6.6 Such evidence, documents, affidavits and indemnifications as may be reasonably required
by the Title Company as a precondition to the issuance of the Title Policy relating to:
(i) mechanics or materialmens liens; (ii) parties in possession; (iii) the status and capacity of
Seller and the authority of the person or persons who are executing the various documents on behalf
of Seller in connection with the sale of the Property; or (iv) any other matter reasonably required
to enable the Title Company to issue the Title Policy and endorsements thereto.


5.6.7 Originals of all documents in the possession of Seller relating to the operation of the
Property including all permits, licenses, approvals, plans, specifications, guaranties and
warranties.


5.6.8 A duly executed closing statement reflecting the adjustments and prorations required by
this Agreement (the Closing Statement).


5.6.9 Such evidence or documents as may reasonably be required by Buyer evidencing the power
and authority of the Seller and its respective partners and the due authority of, and execution and
delivery by, any person or persons who are executing any of the documents required in connection
with the sale of the Property.

contemplated by this Agreement.

persons who are executing any of the documents required in connection with the purchase of the
Property by Buyer.


5.7.5 Such other instruments as may be reasonably required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.


5.8 Costs, Prorations and Credits.


5.8.1 Closing Costs. Buyer and Seller shall each pay their own legal fees related to
the preparation of this Agreement and all documents required to settle the transaction contemplated
hereby. Buyer shall pay (i) all costs associated with its investigation of the Property, including
the cost of appraisals, updated survey, architectural, engineering, credit and environmental
reports, and (ii) title insurance premiums, title examination costs and any extended title
insurance premiums. Seller shall pay all transfer, assumption or waiver fees associated with any
association, declarant or easement holder that holds any right in the Property unless otherwise set
forth herein. Buyer and Seller shall share equally the cost of (a) all transfer taxes and
documentary stamp charges of any jurisdiction, (b) recording fees, and (c) all escrow charges. Any
and all other purchase and sale closing costs shall be paid in accordance with the custom of the
local jurisdiction in which the Property is located.


5.8.2 Prorations. The following shall be prorated, credited, debited and adjusted
between Seller and Buyer as of 12:01 a.m. on the day of the Closing (except as otherwise provided)
in accordance with this section. For purposes of calculating prorations, Buyer shall be deemed to
be in title to the Property, and therefore entitled to the income and responsible for the expenses,
for the entire day upon which the Closing occurs, so long as Seller is paid its closing proceeds by
2:01 p.m. on the Closing Date, otherwise the prorations shall be moved forward one (1) Business
Day. Except as hereinafter expressly provided, all prorations shall be done on the basis of a three
hundred sixty-five (365) day year and the actual number of days elapsed to the Closing Date or the
actual number of days in the month in which the Closing occurs and the actual number of days
elapsed in such month to the Closing Date, as applicable.


(a) Rents. Buyer will receive a credit at Closing for all rents actually collected by
Seller prior to the Closing Date and allocable to the period from and after the Closing Date based
upon the actual number of days in the month. No credit shall be given Seller for accrued and unpaid
rent or any other non-current sums due from tenants until these sums are paid, and Seller shall
retain the right to collect any such rent provided Seller does not sue to evict any tenants or
terminate any Tenant Leases. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller after the Closing Date to collect
any rent under the Tenant Leases which has accrued as of the Closing Date; provided, however, Buyer
shall not be obligated to sue any tenants or exercise any legal remedies under the Tenant Leases or
to incur any expense over and above its own regular collection expenses. All payments collected
from tenants after the Closing Date shall first be applied to the month in which the Closing
occurs, then to any rent due to Buyer for the period after the Closing Date and finally to any rent
due to Seller for the periods prior to Closing Date; provided, however, notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Seller collects any payments from tenants after the Closing Date through its own
collection efforts, Seller may first apply such payments to rent due Seller for the period prior to
the Closing Date.


(b) CAM Expenses. To the extent that tenants are reimbursing the landlord for common
area maintenance and other operating expenses (collectively, CAM Charge(s)), CAM Charges shall be
prorated at Closing as of the Closing Date on a lease-by-lease basis with each party being entitled
to receive a portion of the CAM Charges payable under each Tenant Lease for the CAM Lease Year (as
defined below) in which Closing occurs, which portion shall be equal to the actual CAM Charges
incurred during the partys respective periods of ownership of the Property during the CAM Lease
Year. As used herein, the term CAM Lease Year means the twelve (12) month period as to which
annual CAM Charges are owed under each Tenant Lease. Seller shall be responsible for the CAM
reconciliation on a lease-by-lease basis for their ownership period within the CAM Lease Year up
to, but not including, the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible for the CAM reconciliation on a
lease-by-lease basis for their ownership period within the CAM Lease Year including the Closing
Date. In the event of any expenses, i.e. property taxes, where a proration was based on an estimate
for the year of Closing, a post close true up will be performed for the actual expense to
determine Seller and Buyer obligation for their ownership period for the year of Closing. Each
party will be responsible for any CAM true up necessary to the extent that the Leases provide for
a true up.


(c) Security Deposits, Unpaid Rent Concessions, Unpaid Tenant Improvement Allowances and
Other Tenant Credits. The amount of all unapplied tenant security deposit, any accrued
interest due any tenant thereon, unpaid rent concessions due under any Tenant Lease, unpaid tenant
improvement allowances owing under any Tenant Lease and the amount of any other credits due any
tenant shall be credited to Buyer based on a rental statement prepared by Seller and approved by
Buyer (which statement must be consistent with the applicable Tenant Lease, the estoppel
certificate and the final rent roll).


(d) Property Taxes. All real property taxes for the year immediately preceding the
year of Closing that are payable in the year of Closing, and for years prior thereto, shall be paid
by Seller on or before the Closing. Real property taxes for the year of Closing shall be prorated
on the basis of the most recent assessment and levy. If the most recent tax assessment and levy is
not for the current tax year, then the parties shall reprorate within sixty (60) days of the
receipt of the tax assessment and levy for the current tax year. If after the Closing there is any
retroactive increase in the real or personal property taxes or assessments imposed of the Property:
(1) if such increase relates to the tax year in which the Closing occurred, then such increase
shall be prorated by Seller and Buyer on a per diem basis based on their respective periods of
ownership during their period to which such increase applies, (2) if such increase relates to any
tax year subsequent to the tax year which the Closing occurred, then such increase shall be the
obligation of Buyer, and (3) if such increase relates to any tax year prior to the tax year in
which the Closing occurred, then such increase shall be the obligation of Seller, except to the
extent that such increases are to be collected from tenants under the terms of the Tenant Leases.
Any and all refunds, credits, claims or rights to appeal respecting the amount of any real property
taxes or other taxes or assessments charged in connection with the Property for any period shall
belong to Buyer following the Closing, except that if prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period
Seller has applied for a property tax refund or has appealed the County Assessors valuation of the
Property for any period of time prior to the Closing Date, then Seller shall be entitled to any
refund applicable to such period.


(e) Private Assessments. Payments due under any assessments imposed by private
covenant shall be prorated as of the Closing.


(f) Operating Expenses. All operating expenses (including all charges under the
Service Contracts and agreements assumed by Buyer) shall be prorated, and as to each service
provider, operating expenses payable or paid to such service provider in respect to the billing
period of such service provider in which the Closing occurs (the Current Billing Period), shall
be prorated on a per diem basis based upon the number of days in the Current Billing Period prior
to the Close Date and the number of days in the Current Billing Period from and after the Closing
Date, and assuming that all charges are incurred uniformly during the Current Billing Period. If
actual bills for the Current Billing Period are unavailable as of the Closing Date, then such
proration shall be made on an estimated basis based upon the most recently issued bills, subject to
readjustment upon receipt of actual bills.


(g) Leasing Commissions. At Closing, Buyer shall receive a credit for any tenant
improvement costs, leasing commissions or rent concessions that have not been fully utilized at
Closing and for any tenant improvement costs or leasing commissions that have not been fully
satisfied at Closing (to the extent the credit is not duplicative of amounts to be credited under
Section 5.8.2(c) above).


(h) Items Not Prorated. Seller and Buyer agree that (a) on the Closing Date, the
Property will not be subject to any financing arranged by Seller except as terminated as of the
Closing Date; (b) none of the insurance policies relating to the Property will be assigned to Buyer
and Buyer shall be responsible for arranging for its own insurance as of the Closing Date; and (c)
utilities, including telephone, electricity, water, and gas, shall be read on the Closing Date and
Buyer shall be responsible for all the necessary actions needed to arrange for utilities to be
transferred to the name of Buyer on the Closing Date, including the posting of any required
deposits and Seller shall be entitled to recover and retain from the providers of such utilities
any refunds or overpayments to the extent applicable to the period prior to the Closing Date, and
any utility deposits which it or its predecessors may have posted. Accordingly, there will be no
prorations for debt service, insurance or utilities. In the event a meter reading is unavailable
for any particular utility, such utility shall be prorated in the manner provide.


(i) Other Items. All other items customarily prorated or required by any other
provision of this Agreement to be prorated or adjusted.


5.8.3 Calculation / Re-prorations. Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer no later
than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date an estimated draft closing statement which
shall set forth all costs payable, and the prorations and credits provided for in this Agreement
and to the extent Seller does not timely deliver the estimated closing statement to Buyer, Buyer
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the Closing Date by the number of days
Seller is delinquent in delivering such estimated closing statement to Buyer. Any item which cannot
be finally prorated because of the unavailability of information shall be tentatively prorated on
the basis of the best data then available and adjusted when the information is available in
accordance with this subsection. Buyer shall notify Seller within two (2) days after its receipt of
such estimated closing statement of any items which Buyer disputes and the parties shall attempt in
good faith to reconcile any differences. The estimated closing statement as adjusted as aforesaid
and approved in writing by the parties shall be referred to therein as the Closing Statement. If
the prorations and credits made under the Closing Statement shall prove to be incorrect or
incomplete for any reason, then either party shall be entitled to an adjustment to correct the
same; provided, however, that any adjustment shall be made, if at all, within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date except with respect to CAM Charges, taxes and assessments, in which case such
adjustment shall be made within sixty (60) days after the information necessary to perform such
adjustment is available; provided, however, that Seller and Buyer shall complete their respective
CAM reconciliations and the final adjustment for CAM Charges no later than April 30, 2011), and if
a party fails to request an adjustment to the Closing Statement by a written notice delivered to
the other party within the applicable period set forth above (such notice to specify in reasonable
detail the items within the Closing Statement that such party desires to adjust and the reasons for
such adjustment), then the prorations and credits set forth in the Closing Statement shall be
binding and conclusive against such party.


5.8.4 Reserved.
5.8.5 Survival. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive the Closing for a
period ending on April 30, 2011.

each of the following:


5.9.1 Payment of Encumbrances. Pay the amount of those monetary liens that are not
permitted as part of the Required Title Condition in accordance with the demands approved by
Seller, utilizing funds to which Seller shall be entitled upon Close of Escrow and funds (if any)
deposited in Escrow by Seller.


5.9.2 Non-Recorded Documents. Deliver by overnight courier (or as otherwise requested
by the intended recipient): (i) the Title Policy to Buyer; (ii) each other non-recorded document
received hereunder to the payee or person acquiring rights thereunder or for whose benefit said
document was acquired; and (iii) a copy of each recorded document, conformed to show the recording
data thereon, to each party.


5.9.3 Distribution of Funds. Deliver (i) to Seller, or order, the cash portion of the

Escrow Agents check via overnight courier (or as otherwise requested by the intended recipient) to

Preliminary Report and permitted as part of the Required Title Condition. Seller and Buyer
covenant and agree to execute at Closing a written notice of the acquisition of the Property by
Buyer, in sufficient copies for transmittal to each tenant affected by the sale and purchase of the
Property and properly addressed to each tenant. Such notice shall be prepared by Seller, at
Sellers cost and expense, and approved by Buyer, shall notify the tenant of the sale and transfer
and shall contain appropriate instructions relating to the payment of future rentals, the giving of
future notices and other matters reasonably required by Buyer or required by law. Unless a
different procedure is required by applicable law, in which event such laws shall be controlling,
Buyer agrees to transmit or otherwise deliver such letters to the Tenant promptly after the
Closing.


ARTICLE 6
TERMINATION AND DEFAULT
6.1 BUYER DEFAULT. IF THE SALE CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IS NOT CONSUMMATED BECAUSE OF A DEFAULT
BY BUYER IN ITS OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT
AFTER BUYER HAS FAILED TO CURE SUCH DEFAULT WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF BUYER RECEIVING WRITTEN NOTICE
OF THE SAME EXCEPT BUYERS OBLIGATION TO CLOSE, AS TO WHICH THERE IS NO NOTICE AND CURE PERIOD, AND
SELLER HAS PERFORMED OR TENDERED PERFORMANCE OF ALL OF ITS MATERIAL OBLIGATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, THEN: (A) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL TERMINATE; (B) THE DEPOSIT SHALL BE PAID TO AND
RETAINED BY SELLER AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES; AND (C) SELLER AND BUYER SHALL HAVE NO FURTHER
OBLIGATIONS TO EACH OTHER EXCEPT THOSE WHICH SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. BUYER AND
SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES TO SELLER IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY BUYER
WOULD BE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT PLUS INTEREST
REPRESENTS THE PARTIES BEST AND MOST ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES THAT WOULD BE SUFFERED BY
SELLER IF THE TRANSACTION SHOULD FAIL TO CLOSE AND THAT SUCH ESTIMATE IS REASONABLE UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SELLER AND
BUYER REASONABLY ANTICIPATE WOULD EXIST AT THE TIME OF SUCH BREACH. BUYER AND SELLER AGREE THAT
SELLERS RIGHT TO RETAIN THE DEPOSIT TOGETHER WITH ANY INTEREST AND EARNINGS EARNED THEREON SHALL
BE SELLERS SOLE REMEDY, AT LAW AND IN EQUITY, FOR BUYERS FAILURE TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. SELLER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO AN ACTION FOR
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF ANY PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.



 
 
 


BY PLACING THEIR INITIALS HERE:

 



SELLER,

 
BUYER,



THE PARTIES AGREE TO BUYER DEFAULT PROVISIONS AS SET FORTH ABOVE.
6.2 Sellers Default. If prior to Closing Seller fails to perform any of its obligations
or is otherwise in default hereunder or willfully causes the failure of a condition precedent
pursuant to Section 5.4 hereof and Seller does not cure such default within ten (10) days after
written notice of the same (except for the Sellers obligation to convey the Property at Closing,
as to which there is no notice and cure period), Buyer shall have the right to exercise any or all
of the following remedies:


6.2.1 Waive such failure and proceed to the Closing with no reduction in the Purchase Price;
provided, however, that this provision will not limit Buyers right to receive reimbursement for
attorneys fees pursuant to Section 9.8 below in connection with any legal proceedings instituted
by either party or Escrow Agent with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement, nor waive or
affect any of Sellers other obligations under this Agreement to be performed after the Closing or
Buyers rights to enforce those obligations.


6.2.2 Institute an action for specific performance to cause Seller to convey the Property to
Buyer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.


6.2.3 Terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller and Escrow Agent to that effect, to recover
the full amount of the Deposit and all earnings thereon, to receive reimbursement of Buyers
actually incurred out of pocket costs in conjunction with the Agreement, not to exceed One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), and, provided that (i) Seller willfully refuses to convey the
Property as set forth herein or willfully causes a failure of a condition precedent under Section
5.4 above concerning a matter within the Sellers reasonable control, and further provided that
(ii) specific performance is not available to Buyer as a remedy, to receive reimbursement of
Buyers actually incurred out of pocket costs in conjunction with the Agreement, not to exceed One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), and to recover all other damages and seek such other relief
at law or in equity to which Buyer may be entitled as a result of Sellers breach, but as to
damages, not exceeding a total of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) under the
terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Buyer shall not be required to
fund the balance of the Purchase Price in order to enforce its remedies under this Agreement, so
long as Buyer provides reasonable documentation that Buyer would have been able to fund the balance
of the Purchase Price.


ARTICLE 7
CASUALTY DAMAGE OR CONDEMNATION
7.1 Casualty. If the Improvements are damaged by casualty prior to the Closing and either
(i) the casualty results in loss or damage in an amount valued greater than One Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars (150,000.00), or (ii) the nature of such casualty results in a circumstance
whereby a tenant under the Tenant Leases may terminate its lease or receive a rent abatement, then
Buyer shall have the sole option to elect either to:


(a) acquire the Property as is (without reduction in the Purchase Price), plus an assignment
without recourse or credit of any insurance proceeds payable by virtue of such loss or damage plus
a credit for any deductible under said policy; or


(b) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit.


Such right must be exercised within thirty (30) days from the date Seller provides Buyer with
notice of the loss of the event giving rise to such right. If Buyer fails to provide notice of an
election, then Buyer shall have been deemed to elect (b) above.


7.2 Condemnation. In the event that any material portion of the Real Property, as
reasonably determined by Buyer, should be condemned prior to the Closing, at Buyers sole option,
elect either to:


(a) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit; or


(b) close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.


In all other cases, or if Buyer elects to proceed under Section 7.2(b), Buyer shall purchase
the Property in accordance with the terms hereof (without reduction in the Purchase Price) and
Seller shall assign to Buyer at Closing all condemnation proceeds payable as a result of such
condemnation. Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to proceed under Section 7.2(b) unless, within
twenty (20) days from written notice of the condemnation, Buyer provides Seller with written notice
that Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(a).


ARTICLE 8
REAL ESTATE COMMISSION
8.1 Commissions. Buyer and Seller each represent to the other that no brokers or real
estate commissions or other finders fees, other than a commission payable by Seller to Douglas M.
Connell of Grubb & Ellis Company (the Broker) equal to three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price,
are or shall be due in respect to this transaction by reason of any agreement made or which may be
alleged to have been made by Buyer or Seller. At Closing, Seller shall pay all commissions and
fees owed to Broker pursuant to Sellers separate agreement with Broker. Each party agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the other from and against any and all claims, demands or the cost or
expense thereof, including reasonable attorneys fees, arising out of any brokers commission, fee
or other compensation due or alleged to be due in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon an agreement alleged to have been made or other action alleged to have
been taken by the indemnifying party.

Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and expenses

this Agreement.


9.13 Descriptive Headings; Word Meaning. The descriptive headings of the paragraphs of
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or
construction of any provisions of this Agreement. Words such as herein, hereinafter, hereof
and hereunder when used in reference to this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not merely to a subdivision in which such words appear, unless the context otherwise requires. The
singular shall include the plural and the masculine sender shall include the feminine and neuter,
and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The word including shall not be
restrictive and shall be interpreted as if followed by the words without limitation.


9.14 Business Day. As used herein, the term Business Day means any day other than
Saturday, Sunday and any day which is a legal holiday in the State of Louisiana.


9.15 Construction of Agreement. This Agreement shall not be construed more strictly
against one party than against the other merely by virtue of the fact that it may have been
prepared primarily by counsel for one of the parties, it being recognized that both Buyer and
Seller have contributed substantially and materially to the preparation of this Agreement.


9.16 Severability. The parties hereto intend and believe that each provision in this
Agreement comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions.
However, if any provision in this Agreement is found by a court of law to be in violation of any
applicable local, state or federal law, statute, ordinance, administrative or judicial decision, or
public policy, or if in any other respect such a court declares any such provision to be illegal,
invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written, then it is the intent of all parties hereto
that, consistent with and with a view towards preserving the economic and legal arrangements among
the parties hereto as expressed in this Agreement, such provision shall be given force and effect
to the fullest possible extent, and that the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if
such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable provision were not contained herein, and
that the rights, obligations and interests of the parties under the remainder of this Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect.


9.17 Reserved.


9.18 Section 1031 Exchange. Either party may consummate the purchase or sale of the
Property as part of a so-called like kind exchange (an Exchange) pursuant to section 1031 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), provided that (i) the Closing shall not be
delayed or affected by reason of an Exchange nor shall the consummation or accomplishment of any
Exchange be a condition precedent or condition subsequent to a partys obligations under this
Agreement; (ii) any party desiring an Exchange shall effect its Exchange through an assignment of
this Agreement, or its rights under this Agreement, to a qualified intermediary and the other party
shall not be required to take an assignment of the purchase agreement for the relinquished or
replacement property or be required to acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes of
consummating such Exchange; and (iii) the party desiring an Exchange shall pay any additional costs
that would not otherwise have been incurred by Buyer or Seller had such party not consummated its
purchase or sale through an Exchange. Neither party shall by this agreement or acquiescence to an
Exchange desired by the other party (1) have its rights under this Agreement affected or diminished
in any manner or (2) be responsible for compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to the other
party that such partys Exchange in fact complies with section 1031 of the Code. In connection
with such cooperation, Seller agrees, upon request of Buyer to direct deed for actual interests
in the property to designees of Buyer.


9.19 Cooperation with S-X 3-14 Audit. The Seller acknowledges that Buyer intends to
assign all of its rights, title and interest in and to this Agreement.  The assignee shall be a
subsidiary of a publicly registered company (Registered Company) promoted by the Buyer.  The
Seller acknowledges that it has been advised that if the purchaser is affiliated with such
Registered Company, the assignee is required to make certain filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC Filings) that relate to the most recent pre-acquisition fiscal year
(the Audited Year) and the current fiscal year through the date of acquisition (the stub
period) for the Property. To assist the assignee in preparing the SEC Filings, the Seller agrees
to provide the assignee with the following: (i) access to bank statements for the Audited year and
stub period with respect to building operations; (ii) rent roll as of the end of the Audited Year
and stub period; (iii) operating statements with respect to building operations for the Audited
Year and stub period; (iv) access to the general ledger for the Audited Year and stub period with
respect to building operations; (v) (reserved) (vi) access to invoice for expenses and capital
improvements in the Audited Year and stub period; (vii) (reserved) (viii) check register for the
3-months following the Audited Year and stub period; (ix) all leases and 5-year lease schedules;
(x) copies of all insurance documentation for the Audited Year and stub period; (xi) copies of
accounts receivable aging as of the end of the Audited Year and stub period along with an
explanation for all accounts over 30 days past due as of the end of the Audited Year and stub
period; (xii) signed representation letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D, and (xiv) to
the extent necessary a signed audit letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E and a signed
audit inquiry letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G. To the extent that Seller incurs
accounting charges (at ordinary hourly rates) in excess of $5,000 for such cooperation after
Closing, costs in excess of $5,000 shall be borne by Buyer.


9.20 Seller Escrow. Seller and Buyer agree that on the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Escrow Agent a deposit in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) (the
Seller Escrow). The Seller Escrow shall be held in an insured, interest-bearing account with
interest accruing for the benefit of Seller. For purposes of this Agreement the term Seller
Escrow shall include any and all interest earned thereon. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Seller
Escrow until May 31, 2011, upon which time the Escrow Agent shall immediately release the Seller
Escrow to Seller unless Escrow Agent shall have received a written notice from Buyer (which copies
Seller) that such funds are in dispute due to a breach by Seller of the terms of this Agreement or
a breach by Seller under the documents to be signed at Closing (a Notice of Claim), and in such
event the Escrow Agent shall hold the Seller Escrow until Escrow Agent receives escrow instructions
signed by both Seller and Buyer or a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order authorizing
the release of all or a portion of the Seller Escrow. In the event that Buyer submits a Notice of
Claim with respect to a breach of any of Sellers representations or warranties, Buyer shall file a
lawsuit with respect to the matters set forth in such Notice of Claim no later than the date that
is eleven (11) months after the Closing Date. In the event that Buyer submits a Notice of Claim
with respect to any other breach by Seller of the terms of this Agreement or a breach by Seller
under the documents to be signed at Closing, Buyer shall file a lawsuit with respect to the matters
set forth in such Notice of Claim no later than June 30, 2011. If a lawsuit is not filed by such
date, Escrow Agent shall disburse the balance of the Seller Escrow to Seller without further
authorization or direction. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, in the
event that Escrow Agent has not received a Notice of Claim by the date that is ten (10) months
after the Closing Date, Escrow Agent shall disburse the amount of Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($50,000.00) from Seller Escrow to Seller.


9.21 Buyers Disclosures. Seller acknowledges that Buyer is the subsidiary of a Real
Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and that, as such, it is subject to certain filing and reporting
requirements in accordance with federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to,
regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, and
notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the provisions of any other existing agreement
between the parties hereto to the contrary, Buyer may publically file, disclose, report or publish
any and all information related to this transaction that may be reasonably interpreted as being
required by federal law or regulation.


9.22 Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence in the performance of this
Agreement.


9.23 Continued Performance. Any provisions of this Agreement that by their terms
specifically require observance or performance after the Closing Date shall continue in force and
effect following the Closing Date.


9.24 Louisiana Terminology. As used in this Agreement, the terms real property and
real estate shall be deemed to include immovable property; the term fee title shall include
full ownership; the term personal property shall be deemed to include movable property; the term
tangible personal property shall be deemed to include corporeal property; the term intangible
