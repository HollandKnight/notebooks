and Buyer agree that all utility charges, real estate taxes, assessments and any assumed
liabilities shall be prorated on a calendar-year basis as of the date of Closing, subject to the
obligations of Tenant under the Master Lease. If Closing shall occur before the actual taxes and
special assessments payable during such year are known, the apportionment of taxes shall be upon
the basis of taxes for the Real Property and Improvements payable during the immediately preceding
year, provided that, if the taxes and special assessments payable during the year in which Closing

year, Seller and Buyer promptly shall adjust the proration of such taxes and special assessments,
and Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall pay to the other any amount required as a result of
such adjustment and this covenant shall not merge with the Deed delivered hereunder but shall
survive the Closing. Seller shall be responsible for the payment of all municipal license taxes
payable during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs and corresponding to any period prior
to the Closing Date, and the Master Lease shall require that Tenant pay all such amounts from and
after the Closing Date. Seller shall pay all fees (including defeasance fees), charges and
expenses imposed or assessed in connection with the prepayment of all mortgage loans encumbering
the Property. The premium and related charges for owners title insurance policy to be issued to
Buyer, transfer tax and deed preparation and recording fees necessary to record the deed at the
register of deeds office where each Property is located shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer
in accordance with the custom of the jurisdictions in which the Real Property is located. Buyer
shall be responsible for the cost of its own surveys, Phase 1 environmental studies and due
diligence investigations. Seller and Buyer shall be responsible for their own attorneys fees.

Section 3. Sale of Property. Seller hereby agrees to sell, transfer and convey the
Property to Buyer, and Buyer hereby agrees to purchase and accept the Property from Seller, in each
case for the Purchase Price (as allocated on Exhibit A) and on and subject to the other
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 4. Payment of Purchase Price. Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price in
accordance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price
by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds to the Title Insurer on the morning of the
Closing, and Title Insurer shall disburse all funds it receives from the parties in connection with
the Closing. Seller shall be responsible for any prepayment penalties or fees associated with the
pay-off of debt encumbering the Property.

Section 5. Title. At Closing, Seller agrees to convey to Buyer fee simple
marketable title to the Real Property and Improvements by special warranty deed, free and clear of
all liens, defects of title, conditions, easements, assessments, restrictions, and encumbrances
except for (i) the Master Lease and the Operating Subleases, (ii) taxes for the current year and
subsequent years not yet due and payable (subject to apportionment as provided elsewhere in this
Agreement), (iii) existing zoning laws, ordinances and regulations and other laws, ordinances and
regulations respecting the use, occupancy and operation of the Real Property and Improvements, (iv)
and other exceptions set forth in the Title Report for each location (as defined below) or on a
survey of the Real Property and Improvements which Seller does not agree to cure under Section 6(a)
herein and in which Buyer waives as an Objection pursuant to said Section 6(a) (collectively, the
Permitted Exceptions).

Section 6. Examination of Property. Seller and Buyer hereby agree as follows:

(a) Title Examination. Buyer shall order a title report for each location (collectively, the
Title Reports) from the Title Insurer promptly after the date hereof. Seller shall
deliver a copy of its most recent ALTA survey for each Real Property to the extent within Sellers
possession or readily obtainable by Seller, within three (3) business days after the date hereof
which Buyer shall have the right to have updated and revised to incorporate Buyers survey
requirements. Before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall furnish to Seller a
copy of Buyers Title Reports and surveys, together with a statement specifying any defects in
title and/or the surveys (the Objections). Seller shall notify Buyer within ten (10) days
after receipt of the Objections whether Seller will cure the Objections. If Seller does not
respond within said ten (10) day period, Seller shall be deemed to have elected to not cure the
Objections. If Seller does not agree (or is deemed to not agree) to cure the Objections, Buyer
shall have the right, by notice given to Seller and Title Insurer within ten (10) days after
receipt of Sellers notice (or within ten (10) days of the expiration of Sellers ten (10) day
response period, if Seller does not respond), either to (a) waive the Objections and close title
without abatement or reduction of the Purchase Price, or (b) terminate this Agreement and obtain a
refund of the Earnest Money. If Buyer fails to deliver the Objections to Seller within the Due
Diligence Period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement. If Buyer
elects to terminate this Agreement by notice given to Seller or is deemed to have terminated this
Agreement, the Earnest Money shall be immediately returned to Buyer, and upon such return, except
as expressly provided herein, this Agreement and all rights and obligations of the respective
parties hereunder shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall be required
to cure: (i) any monetary liens or encumbrances against the Property; and (ii) any encumbrances
against title which are created by or through Seller after the date hereof. In the event Seller
fails or refuses to cure monetary liens or encumbrances against the Property, Buyer may, but is not
obligated to, elect to satisfy such monetary liens or encumbrances and deduct the costs of the cure
from the Purchase Price.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not create, place, grant, convey, or otherwise
voluntarily cause or otherwise consent to any liens, encumbrances or restrictions affecting the
Real Property and Improvements, or any part thereof, to be created or suffered following the
Effective Date of this Agreement, nor will Seller during said period convey any interest in the
Property to anyone other than Buyer without Buyers prior written consent, which consent Buyer may
withhold in its absolute discretion. At Closing, Seller will cause the Property to be released or
otherwise discharged from any lien securing the payment of a sum certain which has been voluntarily
created by, or with the consent of, Seller or will bond over said lien to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer and Buyers title insurance company sufficient to cause said company to
insure over said lien.


Any exceptions to title to the Real Property or Improvements that arise between the Effective
Date of the title commitment obtained by Buyer and the Closing are referred to herein as New
Defects. Buyer may notify Seller in writing (the Gap Notice) of any New Defect (a)
raised by the Title Insurer between the Effective Date of the Title Commitment and the Closing (the
Gap) and (b) not otherwise known to Buyer prior to the Effective Date of the Title
Commitment; provided that Buyer must notify Seller of such objection to title within two (2)
business days of being made aware of the existence of such exceptions. If Buyer sends a Gap Notice
to Seller, Buyer and Seller shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to such notice
as exist in Section 6(a) of this Agreement with respect to the Objection Notice.


(b) Examination. Within five (5) days following execution of this Agreement, Seller
shall provide to Buyer copies of the following documents and materials pertaining to the Property
to the extent within Sellers possession or readily obtainable by Seller: all contracts,
subcontracts or agreements affecting the Property (the Contracts); title
commitment/policy, title exceptions, ALTA survey, site plans and specifications, architectural
plans, environmental/hazardous material reports, structural reports, soils reports, governmental
permits/approvals, zoning information, copies of tax bills, condemnation notices, operating expense
information and reports, and utility letters and copies of all correspondence related to the plans
and specification for the Improvements, any documents required to be delivered by Seller to Buyer
pursuant to Schedule 6 attached hereto, and any other documents relating to the Property
reasonably requested by Buyer. Seller shall send all such due diligence items to Buyer at the
address set forth in Section 1(n), to the attention of Phil Han. Seller is not required to deliver
an additional copy of such due diligence items to each party listed in Section 1(n). Additionally,
during the term of this Agreement, Buyer, its agents and designees, shall have the right to enter
the Real Property and Improvements for the purposes of inspecting the same, conducting soil tests,
and making surveys, mechanical and structural engineering studies, inspecting construction, and
conducting any other interviews, investigations and inspections as Buyer may reasonably require to
assess the condition and suitability of the Property; provided, however, that such activities by or
on behalf of Buyer on the Real Property and Improvements shall not damage the same nor interfere
with the conduct of business by the occupants thereof; and provided further, however, that Buyer
shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any and all claims or damages to the
extent directly resulting from the activities of Buyer thereon (but not claims or damages arising
out of the findings of such activities), and Buyer shall repair any and all damage caused, in whole
or in part, by Buyer and return the Real Property and Improvements to their condition prior to such
damage, which obligation shall survive Closing or any termination of this Agreement. Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with the efforts of Buyer and the Buyers representatives to inspect the
Property. After the Effective Date, Buyer shall be permitted to speak and meet with Tenant in
connection with Buyers due diligence. Buyer shall give Seller reasonable notice before entering
the Real Property and Improvements, and Seller may have a representative present during any and all
examinations, inspections and/or studies on the Property. Buyer shall have the unconditional
right, for any reason or no reason, to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to
Seller prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, in which event this Agreement shall
become null and void. If Buyer terminates this Agreement, Buyer shall receive a refund of the
Earnest Money (which right shall survive such termination), and all rights, liabilities and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall expire, except as otherwise expressly set
forth herein.


(c) Buyer covenants and agrees that the information relating to the Property delivered to
Buyer will be kept confidential by Buyer and will not be used for any purpose other than in
connection with an evaluation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard such information from unauthorized disclosure. Buyer
may disclose such information to its directors, employees, accountants, attorneys, other
representatives and as otherwise required by law. The foregoing shall not apply to (i) information
that was in the public domain prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) information that is
published or otherwise becomes part of the public domain after the date of this Agreement through a
party other than Buyer, or (iii) information that becomes available to Buyer on a non-confidential
basis from a source other than Seller or its representatives (whether directly or indirectly) and
which source to the best of its knowledge did not acquire the information on a confidential basis.


(d) Prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, the Board of Directors of Grubb &
Ellis Healthcare REIT II, Inc. shall have approved the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.


Section 7. Risk of Loss/Condemnation. Upon an occurrence of a casualty,
condemnation or taking, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of same. Until Closing, the risk of
loss or damage to the Property shall be borne by Seller. In the event all or any portion of the
Property is damaged in any casualty or condemned or taken and the Operating Subtenant of the
affected Facilities terminates the Operating Sublease pursuant to the terms of the Operating
Sublease, Seller or Buyer may elect to terminate this Agreement with regard to the Facility so
condemned or damaged, by providing written notice of such termination to the other party within ten
(10) business days after Buyers receipt of such notice of termination of the Operating Sublease,
upon which termination the Earnest Money shall be returned to the Buyer and neither party hereto
shall have any further rights, obligations or liabilities under this Agreement with regard to
affected Facility, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein. With respect to any
condemnation or taking (of any notice thereof), if neither Seller nor Buyer elect to terminate this
Agreement as aforesaid, then the parties shall proceed to Closing in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement without abatement of the Purchase Price and upon Closing the awards, if any, for the
condemnation or taking shall be allocated between Buyer, as Landlord, and the Tenant, all as
provided in Section 8 of the Master Lease. With respect to a casualty, if neither Seller nor Buyer
elect to terminate this Agreement, then the parties shall proceed to Closing in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement without abatement of the Purchase Price and upon Closing all insurance
proceeds shall be assigned or paid over to the party entitled to same under Article 7 of the Master
Lease and applied to the Restoration of the affected Facility as provided therein.

Section 8. Earnest Money Disbursement. The Earnest Money shall be held by the Title
Insurer, in trust, and disposed of only in accordance with the following provisions:

(a) Upon receipt of the Earnest Money, Title Insurer shall deliver to Seller and Buyer written
notice confirming Title Insurers receipt of the Earnest Money, the date on which Title Insurer
received the Earnest Money and that the Earnest Money has been deposited as required by this
Agreement. The Title Insurer shall invest the Earnest Money in a money market account reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, and shall promptly provide Buyer and Seller with confirmation of the
investments made.


(b) If the Closing occurs, the Title Insurer shall deliver the applicable portion of the
Earnest Money (excluding the Columbia Earnest Money) to White Oaks CG, White Oaks Joplin and White
Oak Athens at Closing and the same shall be credited against the applicable Purchase Price payable
to each. If the Columbia Closing occurs, the Title Insurer shall deliver the Columbia Earnest
Money to White Oaks Columbia at the Columbia Closing and the same shall be credited against the
Purchase Price payable to White Oaks Columbia. If for any reason the Closing and/or the Columbia
Closing do not occur, the Title Insurer shall deliver the Earnest Money and/or the Columbia Earnest
Money (as applicable) to Seller or Buyer only upon receipt of a written demand therefor from such
party, except where this paragraph expressly provides for notice only from Buyer. Subject to the
last sentence of this clause (b), if for any reason the Closing or the Columbia Closing does not
occur and either party makes a written demand (the Demand) upon the Title Insurer for
payment of the Earnest Money, the Title Insurer shall give written notice to the other party of the
Demand within one business day after receipt of the Demand. If the Title Insurer does not receive
a written objection from the other party to the proposed payment within five (5) business days
after the giving of such notice by Title Insurer, the Title Insurer is hereby authorized to make
the payment set forth in the Demand. If the Title Insurer does receive such written objection
within such period, the Title Insurer shall continue to hold such amount until otherwise directed
by written instructions signed by Seller and Buyer or a final judgment of a court. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this clause (b) if Buyer delivers a notice to Title Insurer stating
that Buyer has terminated this Agreement on or prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period,
then Title Insurer shall immediately return the Earnest Money to Buyer without the necessity of
delivering any notice to, or receiving any notice from Seller.


(c) The parties acknowledge that the Title Insurer is acting solely as a stakeholder at their
request and for their convenience, that the Title Insurer shall not be deemed to be the agent of
either of the parties, and that the Title Insurer shall not be liable to either of the parties for
any action or omission on its part taken or made in good faith, and not in disregard of this
Agreement, but shall be liable for its negligent acts and for any liabilities (including reasonable
attorneys fees, expenses and disbursements) incurred by Seller or Buyer resulting from the Title
Insurers mistake of law respecting the Title Insurer scope or nature of its duties. Seller and
Buyer shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold the Title Insurer harmless from and against
all liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and disbursements) incurred in
connection with the performance of the Title Insurers duties hereunder, except with respect to
actions or omissions taken or made by the Title Insurer in bad faith, in disregard of this
Agreement or involving negligence on the part of the Title Insurer. The Title Insurer has executed
this Agreement in the place indicated on the signature page hereof in order to confirm that the
Title Insurer has received and shall hold the Earnest Money in escrow, and shall disburse the
Earnest Money pursuant to the provisions of this Section 8.


(d) Buyer and Seller, together, shall have the right to terminate the appointment of Title
Insurer hereunder by giving to it notice of such termination, specifying the date upon which such
termination shall take effect and designating a replacement Title Insurer, who shall sign a
counterpart of this Agreement. Upon demand of such successor Title Insurer, the Earnest Money shall
be turned over and delivered to such successor Title Insurer, who shall thereupon be bound by all
of the provisions hereof. Title Insurer may resign at will and be discharged from its duties or
obligations hereunder by giving notice in writing of such resignation specifying a date when such
resignation shall take effect; provided, however, that (i) prior to such resignation a substitute
escrow agent is approved in writing by Seller and Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, or (ii) Title Insurer shall deposit the Earnest Money with a court of
competent jurisdiction. After such resignation, Title Insurer shall have no further duties or
liability hereunder.


(e) Title Insurers agreements and obligations hereunder with respect to the Earnest Money
shall terminate and Title Insurer shall be discharged from further duties and obligations hereunder
upon final payment of the Earnest Money in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.


Section 9. Default

(a) If Seller is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and Buyer defaults in any of its obligations undertaken in this Agreement,
and should such default continue for a period of ten (10) business days after the date on which
Buyer receives Sellers written notice of default, then Seller shall be entitled to, as its sole
and exclusive remedy to either: (i) if Buyer is willing to proceed with Closing, waive such
default and proceed to Closing in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof; or (ii) declare
this Agreement to be terminated, and Seller shall be entitled to immediately receive all of the
Earnest Money as liquidated damages as and for Sellers sole remedy. Upon such termination,
neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any further rights, obligations or liabilities hereunder,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein. Seller and Buyer agree that (a) actual damages due
to Buyers default hereunder would be difficult and inconvenient to ascertain and that such amount
is not a penalty and is fair and reasonable in light of all relevant circumstances, (b) the amount
specified as liquidated damages is not disproportionate to the damages that would be suffered and
the costs that would be incurred by Seller as a result of having withdrawn the Property from the
market, and (c) Buyer desires to limit its liability under this Agreement to the amount of the
Earnest Money paid in the event Buyer fails to complete Closing. Seller hereby waives any right to
recover the balance of the Purchase Price, or any part thereof, and the right to pursue any other
remedy permitted at law or in equity against Buyer. In no event under this Section or otherwise
shall Buyer be liable to Seller for any punitive, speculative or consequential damages.


(b) In the event of a default in the obligations herein taken by Seller, including, without
limitation, the failure of a condition precedent set forth in Section 13 of this Agreement, Buyer
may, either waive such default and proceed to Closing in accordance with the terms and provisions
hereof or may in its sole discretion elect to either (i) terminate this Agreement, whereupon Title
Insurer shall return the Earnest Money to Buyer and Seller shall pay to Buyer all of the

Section 17. Bulk Transfer Tax Clearance. The parties acknowledge that the laws of
the state in which the Property is located may require that, as a result of the sale of the
Property to Buyer, certain governmental agencies or authorities be notified in advance of the

further may require that Seller (and in certain circumstances, Sellers direct or indirect owners)
obtain and/or deliver to Buyer a clearance certificate evidencing the payment by Seller of certain

governmental agencies or authorities, in advance of Closing, as required under such laws, and shall
use their its best efforts to promptly obtain and deliver to Buyer such applicable clearance

procedures for the administration of applications for such clearance certificate, and anticipated
delays therein, it may not be possible for Seller to obtain and deliver such clearance certificate
as of the Closing Date, or for some period of time thereafter. Seller shall nevertheless deliver
to Buyer at Closing evidence reasonably acceptable to Buyer and to the Title Insurer that such
applicable notices (in proper form) have been timely delivered and, if such notices are statutorily
required, that all tax returns for periods prior to the tax fiscal year(s) in which the Closing

reasonable diligence to apply for, obtain and (upon receipt) deliver to Buyer (with copies to the
Title Insurer) all statutorily required clearance certificates at or as soon after the Closing Date
as is reasonably possible. If any such clearance certificate is not available at the Closing, the
failure to deliver such clearance certificate shall not constitute a deficiency in the quality of
title that Seller is required by this Agreement to convey, provided that the Title Insurer shall
raise no exception therefor in the title policy, and provided further that (i) no liens or claims
for unpaid taxes shall then have been assessed against Seller or the Property, and (ii) Seller
delivers to the Title Insurer and Buyer at Closing a written indemnification agreement in form and
content, and issued by Seller and/or a party, reasonably acceptable to Buyer and its counsel
relating to liabilities that may arise against Buyer and the Property as a result of the Sellers
failure to obtain and deliver such clearance certificates as of the Closing.

are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not apply to the interpretation of this
Agreement.

thereof to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid or unenforceable, at any time or to any
extent, then the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to persons or

finders fee or similar compensation made by any broker, finder or any party who claims to have
dealt with such party (except that Buyer shall have no obligations hereunder with respect to any
claim by Broker). The representations, warranties and indemnity obligations contained in this
section shall survive the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement.

consummate the purchase of the Columbia Property on the Columbia Closing Date. In the event that
the long-term acute care hospital operated from the Columbia Property does not satisfy the Rent
Coverage Contingency on or before October 30, 2011, then Buyer shall elect either (i) not to
purchase the Columbia Property, or (ii) to purchase the Columbia Property despite the fact that the
Rent Coverage Contingency has not been satisfied. Buyer shall make such election in writing to
Seller on or before November 30, 2011, in which event the Columbia Closing Date shall be on a
