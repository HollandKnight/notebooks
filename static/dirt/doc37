agreement (except to the extent the licensor agrees to any changes requested by Buyer), to be effective upon Closing and (E) comply with all other conditions imposed by the licensor, in accordance with its current licensing policies, for the
issuance of such New License effective upon Closing. Upon Closing, Seller shall surrender its existing licenses under the Hotel Licensing Agreement, and agree to terminate those agreements, in such form as the licensor under each may reasonably
require.  8.        Prorations, Credits and Other Adjustments.  At
Closing, the Parties shall make the prorations and other adjustments provided below, and the net amount consequently owing to Seller or Buyer shall be added to or subtracted from the proceeds of the Purchase Price payable to Seller at Closing.

Final Statement as prepared by Buyer, except for such items as to which Seller specifically objects in a written notice given to Buyer within sixty (60) days after Buyer delivers the Final Statement to Seller.

item(s) on the Final Statement, and Seller and Buyer are unable between themselves to resolve each such action and agree upon the Final Statement within thirty (30) days after Buyer delivers the Final Statement to Seller, then any Party may
submit the unresolved items to a mutually agreeable national accounting firm (or, if the Parties are unable to agree on such firm within forty (40) days after Buyer delivers the Final Statement to Seller or such firm is unwilling to handle the
dispute, to a qualified neutral party designated by the American Arbitration Association office located in Boston, Massachusetts) for a determination which shall be binding and conclusive upon all Parties and shall become part of agreed Final
Statement. Seller and Buyer shall pay in equal shares the fees and other expenses of such accounting firm or other designated neutral party for making such determination. 
11.3    Settlement.  Within ten (10) Business Days after the Final Statement
has been agreed Seller and Buyer or after the last timely objection by Seller has been resolved under Section 11.2, Buyer or Seller (as the case may be) shall pay to the other the net amount owing on the settlement for the Closing prorations,
credits and other adjustments, as shown by the agreed Final Statement. Except for mathematical error manifest on the face of the Final Statement, no further adjustments or payments shall be required with respect to such prorations, credits and other

(B) Employee Liabilities arising or accruing before Closing, to the extent that Buyer has received a proration credit therefor, (C) obligations under the Assumed Contracts arising or accruing from and after Closing or, to the extent Buyer
has received a proration credit therefore, before Closing, and (D) the Hotel Payables to the extent Buyer has received a proration credit therefore. Seller shall hold harmless, indemnify and defend Buyer from and against any and all Claims
which Buyer incurs by reason of any obligation or liability relating to the period prior to the Closing Date (except to the extent assumed by Buyer hereunder), including, without limitation (i) the Employee Liabilities arising or accruing prior
to Closing, except to the extent that Buyer has received a proration credit therefor, (ii) any Service Contracts which are excluded from the Assumed Contracts and (iii) any Disputed Payables (or any other Hotel Payable to the extent Buyer

12.2.1    Buyers Obligations. Upon Closing Buyer shall: 
12.2.1.1    Offer to employ (or cause Buyers Hotel manager or operator to offer to employ)
employment to a sufficient number of Eligible Employees, in the same position or job classification and at no less than the same wage or salary level as such Hotel Employee held and enjoyed immediately prior to Closing, and with reasonably
equivalent benefits to prevent Seller from incurring liability under the WARN Act effective as of Closing. 
12.2.1.2    Assume (A) all Employee Liabilities with respect to the Continuing Employees
accruing or first arising on and after the Closing Date, or triggered by a termination of employment at the Hotel after Closing, and (B) all Employee Liabilities which have been prorated under Section 8.

breach by Buyer of its obligations under this Section 12.2.1 or (B) Employee Liabilities with respect to Continuing Employees accruing or first arising on and after the Closing Date, or triggered by a termination of employment after
Closing.  12.3    Indemnification of Related Persons.  Any
indemnification of a Party against third-person claims contained herein shall also run in favor of such Partys partners, 
 
34 


shareholders, beneficial owners, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and
managers (including, without limitation, the Hotel Manager), all of whom are intended by the Parties to be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 12. 
13.        Hotel Records. 
13.1.1    From and after the date hereof, until two (2) years after the
Closing, Seller shall make the books and records for the period Seller owned the Hotel available to Buyer and Buyers independent accountants for inspection, copying and audit by Buyers designated accountants at Buyers sole cost and

(2) years.  13.1.2    Seller shall retain the originals of all Hotel
Records other than Service Contracts and Equipment Leases assigned to Buyer. As reasonably required for tax filings, preparation and auditing of financial statements, other reporting and purposes, Buyer shall have the right to make and retain copies

thereof; and Seller shall not dispose of any Hotel Records prior to the fifth anniversary of Closing without giving Buyer at least 30 days prior written notice and opportunity to recover the same. 
14.        Assignment.  Neither this Agreement nor any of Buyers rights
hereunder may be assigned, encumbered or transferred without Sellers prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to Closing, Buyer shall have a one-time right to assign or transfer its rights under this Agreement to a
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity which is wholly owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by Buyer, provided that (i) Buyer gives Seller at least ten days prior written notice of such assignment,
(ii) the assignee concurrently with such assignment assumes, in a written instrument delivered and satisfactory in form to Seller, all of the obligations and liabilities of Buyer hereunder and (iii) such assignment shall not invalidate, or
require the revision or resubmission of request for, any third party consent necessary for Closing (including, without limitation, the New Licenses) or otherwise delay Closing. Provided that such assignee maintains an unencumbered net worth of at
least equal to 20% of the Purchase Price for nine (9) months after the Closing Date, then any assignment of this Agreement undertaken in accordance with the provisions of this Section 14 shall operate to release the Buyer named herein from
the obligations and liabilities of Buyer hereunder.

 and shall be deemed delivered and received (A), if delivered or transmitted before 5:00 p.m.
recipients local time on a Business Day, or if tendered for delivery between the hours 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. recipients local time on a Business Day and refused, then on the date of actual (or refused) delivery or actual transmission
as evidenced by postal or courier receipt (or by a completed transmission log sheet generated by the sending telecopier) and (B), otherwise, on the Business Day next following the date of actual delivery or transmission; provided, however, that any
communication delivered by Fax must be confirmed within three Business Days by duplicate notice delivered as otherwise provided herein and any refused delivery must re-tendered within two Business Days. 
16.         General Provisions. 
16.1    Confidentiality.  Except for Permitted Disclosures (defined below),
(A) Buyer shall keep confidential the terms of this Agreement, and (B) until and unless the Closing occurs, Buyer shall keep confidential all information regarding the Hotel. In addition, except as required by Law, no party shall issue any
press release or communication with the public prior to Closing without the prior written consent of the other. As used herein, Permitted Disclosures include only (i) disclosures by Buyer to its attorneys, accountants and other
consultants as reasonably necessary in negotiation of this Agreement, the conduct of due diligence, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the exercise of Buyers rights and the performance its duties hereunder,
(ii) disclosure to any government regulatory agency which requests the information in question in the course of its regulatory functions, and (iii) any other disclosure required by Law (including, without limitation, in response to any
subpoena). In the case of any Permitted Disclosure described in clause (i) above, Buyer shall advise the person to whom such disclosure is made of the confidential nature of any information disclosed and obtain from such person an undertaking
to respect such confidentiality. Any confidentiality agreement regarding the Hotel or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement previously made between the Parties or their agents shall continue in full force and effect and shall not be deemed
to have merged into, or been superseded by, this Agreement.  16.2      Effect
of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, no Party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other hereunder except (i) as provided below 
 
37 


(regarding Buyers return or destruction of materials received from Seller),
(ii) any liability which any Party may have hereunder by reason of the fact that termination either (A) was wrongfully made by it or (B) resulted from a breach of its covenants or other obligations hereunder and (iii) any
obligation of Seller under Sections 4.6 or 16.9. Within thirty (30) days after termination of this Agreement without Closing, Buyer shall either return to Seller all materials of a confidential nature which Buyer has received from Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or confirm to Seller in writing that Buyer has destroyed all such materials. Within thirty (30) days after Sellers request following the termination of this Agreement without Closing, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller all reports, studies and analyses prepared by third parties at Buyers request or direction relating to the Hotel Premises (unless this Agreement has been terminated due to the default of Seller). 
16.3    Construction; Participation in Drafting. Each Party acknowledges that it and its
Counsel have participated substantially in the drafting of this Agreement and agree that, accordingly, in the interpretation and construction of this Agreement, no ambiguity, real or apparent, in any provision hereof shall be construed against a
Party by reason of the role of such Party or its Counsel in the drafting of such provision. 
16.4    No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly provided in Section 12.3,
nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall construed to confer any rights or remedies on any person other than the Parties and their active successors and assigns, or to relieve, discharge or alter the obligations of any third person to either
Party or to give any third person any right of subrogation or action over against Party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Hotel Employee shall be deemed a third party beneficiary of any provision of this Agreement. 
16.5    Integration and Binding Effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among
the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and representations of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof (including, without limitation, any letter of intent, offer sheet,
brokers set-up, disclosure materials, offering circular or other such written materials of any kind). This Agreement may not be modified, amended, supplemented or otherwise changed, except by a writing executed by all Parties. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 
16.6    Computation of Time. Any time period specified in this Agreement which would otherwise
end on a non-Business Day shall automatically be extended to the immediately following Business Day. 
16.7     Captions. Article and section headings used herein are for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect the construction of any provision of this Agreement. 
16.8    Further Assurances. The Parties shall cooperate with each other as reasonably
necessary to effect the provisions of this Agreement, shall use reasonable and good faith efforts to satisfy conditions to Closing and, at and after Closing, shall each execute and deliver such additional instruments or other documents as the other
Party may reasonably request to accomplish the purposes and intent of this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this   
38 


Section shall be deemed to enlarge the obligations of the Parties hereunder or to require
any to incur any material expense or liability not otherwise required of it hereunder. 
16.9        Enforcement Costs.  Should either Buyer or Seller
institute any action or proceeding to enforce any provision of this Agreement or for damages by reason of any alleged breach of any provision hereof, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party all costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by such prevailing Party in connection with such action or proceeding. A Party also shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in the
enforcement of any judgment or settlement in its favor obtained in such action or proceeding (and in any such judgment, provision shall be made for the recovery of such post-judgment costs and expenses.) 
16.10        GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO
BE AN AGREEMENT MADE UNDER THE LAW OF THE STATE WHERE THE HOTEL PREMISES ARE LOCATED AND FOR ALL PURPOSES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS. 
16.11        Counterparts.  This Agreement, and any amendment
hereto, may be executed in any number of counterparts and by each Party on Separate counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

Seller shall have the right, at any time no later than ten Business Days after the Effective
Date, to deliver to Buyer either the initial or an amended version of any or all of Exhibits H, I, J, K, M N, O, and P. 
18.        Limitation on Remedies for Sellers Breach. In the event Seller in breach
of this Agreement fails to close, then, provided that Purchaser is not in material default under this Agreement on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be entitled, as its sole remedy, to either (i) the return of the Deposit together with all
interest thereon or (ii) to seek specific performance of this Agreement, provided that any action for specific performance must be initiated no later than thirty (30) days after the default by Seller. Upon Seller providing such remedies to
Purchaser, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any rights against or obligations to the other arising out of this Agreement, except for obligations that expressly survive termination of this Agreement. 
19.        LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF REMEDIES FOR BUYERS BREACH. IF
BUYER IN BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT FAILS TO CLOSE, THEN UPON WRITTEN NOTICE OF TERMINATION (A TERMINATION NOTICE) FROM SELLER TO BUYER AND ESCROW AGENT, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL TERMINATE (EXCEPT FOR THIS SECTION AND BUYERS OBLIGATIONS
PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 4.6, 16.2 AND 16.9). THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE BY INITIALING THIS SECTION 19 THAT: 
19.1    IF BUYER FAILS TO CLOSE IN BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER WILL INCUR CERTAIN COSTS AND
OTHER DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICAL TO ASCERTAIN. 
19.2    THE DEPOSIT, TOGETHER WITH ALL INTEREST EARNED THEREON, BEARS A REASONABLE RELATIONSHIP TO
THE DAMAGES WHICH THE PARTIES ESTIMATE MAY BE SUFFERED BY SELLER BY REASON OF SUCH A FAILURE OF CLOSING TO OCCUR, AND THE DEPOSIT AND INTEREST IS NOT AN AMOUNT WHICH IS UNREASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AT THE TIME THIS AGREEMENT IS MADE
(BUYER ACKNOWLEDGING AND AGREEING THAT BUYER HAS FULLY CONSIDERED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 19 AND SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES PRIOR TO ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND HAS CONSULTED WITH BUYERS COUNSEL WITH RESPECT THERETO); AND 
19.3    UPON DELIVERY TO ESCROW AGENT BY SELLER OF A PROPERLY GIVEN TERMINATION NOTICE, SELLER SHALL
BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND RETAIN THE DEPOSIT, TOGETHER WITH ALL INTEREST EARNED THEREON, AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, WHICH DAMAGES SHALL BE SELLERS SOLE REMEDY HEREUNDER IF BUYER IN BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT FAILS TO CLOSE, AND BUYER SHALL
FORTHWITH INSTRUCT ESCROW AGENT TO RELEASE THE DEPOSIT AND ALL INTEREST EARNED THEREON TO SELLER AND TO RETURN TO SELLER ALL DOCUMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS THERETOFORE DEPOSITED INTO THE ESCROW BY OR ON BEHALF OF THEM; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE DEPOSIT
SHALL BE IN ADDITION TO AND NOT IN LIEU OF ANY AMOUNTS OWED TO SELLER BY BUYER AS A RESULT OF BUYERS OBLIGATIONS PURSUANT TO   
40 


SECTIONS 4.6, 16.2 AND 16.9; AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT SELLER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER
FROM BUYER ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER DIRECT OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS INCURRED BY THEM IN CONNECTION WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OR DEFENSE OF OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 19.
