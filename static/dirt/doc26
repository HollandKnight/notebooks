limited to, gas, electricity, water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, telephone and other telecommunication utilities, are available at the Property line, in such capacities and in such locations as are satisfactory to Buyer. If such utilities are not

(vi) Buyer shall have determined, in its sole discretion, that the Property has free, unrestricted and direct legal rights of access and
ingress and egress to one or more public roads or highways, with access drives and curb cuts to such specifications and in such number and at such locations as deemed necessary or desirable by Buyer.

(ix) Buyer shall have determined, in its sole discretion, that the Property is not
protected habitat for any endangered or protected species of plant, animal or other living organism.  (x) Buyer shall have
determined, in its sole and absolute discretion, that: (i) it can develop a feasible site plan for its proposed development; and (ii) the acquisition and development of the Property presents a viable economic opportunity. 
(xi) Buyer shall have obtained financing acceptable to Buyer, in its sole discretion, for its acquisition of the Property. 
(xii) Buyer and Seller shall have agreed upon the list of Personal Property to be transferred pursuant to this Agreement, which Personal
Property is listed in Exhibit E attached hereto.  (xiii) Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate with Buyer, including
furnishing Buyer with all necessary information, as may be required, in connection with Buyers satisfaction of the above Conditions, all at no cost to Seller. 
(c) Since April 7, 2010, Buyer and its agents have had and shall continue to have the right at reasonable times agreed upon by
Seller and Buyer after reasonable notice to Seller to enter upon the Property and make and conduct any and all tests and inspections that Buyer deems necessary and/or appropriate to satisfy Buyer as to the condition of the Property; provided,
however, that Buyer shall (i) conduct such tests and inspections so as not to interfere unreasonably with the use of the Property by Seller, and (ii) promptly restore any damage to the Property resulting from the entry of Buyer or its
agents. If Buyer desires to do any invasive testing (the Invasive Testing) of the Property, then (A) such Invasive Testing and the plans must be approved by Seller in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; (B) Buyer first executes and delivers to Seller such indemnities, insurance, proof of financial responsibility and other agreements and documents as Seller may reasonably require in connection with any Invasive Testing; (C) Buyer

from and against any and all claims for damage, personal injury, death, or damage to the environment, including without limitation fines, penalties, interest, costs and attorneys fees, arising from activities conducted by or at the request of
Buyer in connection with Buyers investigation of the Property, including the suitability and condition of the Property, other than claims caused by the negligence or intentional acts of Seller. Buyers restoration, indemnity and hold
harmless obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement. The foregoing shall in no event be deemed to impose any liability upon Buyer for Buyers mere discovery of an adverse physical or environmental condition at the Property.

provided in this Agreement. The Earnest Money shall be credited in full against the Purchase Price at Closing, or paid to Seller in the event of

common area or similar costs under any such restrictive covenants.  8. Taxes and Assessments. Buyer shall
assume and agree to pay: (i) all assessments for municipal improvements becoming a lien against the Property after the Closing; and (ii) so much of the ad valorem real estate taxes and assessments assessed against the Property for and
becoming a lien during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs as shall be allocable to Buyer for the period on and after the Closing Date, and Seller shall pay the balance of such taxes, using, for Closing purposes, the most current tax bill,
or the tax rate and valuation assessment existing at the Closing Date if the applicable tax rate or assessment has not then been determined. Any taxes and assessments not assumed by Buyer and not due and payable at the time of Closing, including
without limitation, all installments of real estate taxes payable during the calendar year in which Closing occurs, shall be allowed to Buyer as a credit against the cash payment required at Closing, and Seller shall not be further liable for such

in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to any sums previously paid or then payable to Seller by the insurance carrier (plus an amount equal to the amount of the deductible feature of the Sellers insurance policy
and the amount of any uninsured casualty) or by the condemning authority, by reason of any such casualty or by reason of any such taking, appropriation or action or proceeding in lieu thereof, and Seller shall transfer and assign to Buyer at Closing
any and all further insurance or condemnation proceeds, claims, demands, actions and choses in action which may exist by virtue of such casualty, taking, appropriation or action or proceeding in lieu thereof; provided, however, that until the

11001 et seq.); each as heretofore and hereafter amended or supplemented, and any future or present local, state or federal statute, rule or regulation pertaining to the regulation and protection of the environment, industrial hygiene, pollution, or
environmental effects on health and safety.  (j) There are no general assignments for the benefit of creditors, or voluntary
or involuntary proceedings in bankruptcy, existing, pending or, to the best of Sellers knowledge, threatened against Seller. 
References to the best of Sellers knowledge shall refer only to the actual, present knowledge of Kirk Misaka (the
Sellers Knowledge Party), as of the Effective Date and as of the Closing Date, without any duty of inquiry or investigation. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Sellers Knowledge Party shall have no personal liability for
the representations and warranties made in this Section 15 or elsewhere in this Agreement.  The representations and
warranties in Section 15 shall survive the Closing Date for a period of one (1) year. No claim for a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller shall be actionable or payable if Buyer had actual knowledge (or had information
provided by its representatives and consultants) of the breach in question prior to Closing and Buyer had the right to terminate this Agreement as a result thereof pursuant to the terms hereof, and Buyer nevertheless proceeds to Closing. After the
Closing, other than in the case of Seller fraud, Seller shall have no liability to Buyer for a breach of any representation or warranty (i) unless the valid claims for all such breaches collectively aggregate more than Twenty Five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000), in which event the full amount of such valid claims shall be actionable with respect to actual damages (but in no event any punitive, consequential, or special damages) up to a limit of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000),
and (ii) unless written notice containing a description of the specific nature of such breach shall have been given by Buyer to Seller prior to the expiration of the applicable period specified in the first sentence of this paragraph and an
action shall have been commenced by Buyer against Seller within sixty (60) days after expiration of such applicable period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyers claims hereunder shall exceed the sum of Twenty Five Thousand Dollars
($25,000), then Seller shall be liable to Buyer hereunder for Buyers losses starting with dollar one (as opposed to simply the losses exceeding Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000)). 
16. Buyers Representations, Warranties and Release of Claims. Buyer hereby warrants and represents to Seller, as of the
Effective Date and as of the Closing Date, as follows:   
-12- 


(a) The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement
will not conflict with or result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any of the provisions of any law, governmental rule, regulations, judgment, decree or order by which the Buyer is bound, or by any of the provisions of any contract to
which the Buyer is bound, or by the organic agreements establishing and regulating the buyers business affairs, and the Buyer has full power and authority to enter into and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all
consents and approvals necessary therefor have been obtained.  (b) There is no action, suit, arbitration, unsatisfied order or
judgment, government investigation or proceeding pending or to the best of Buyers knowledge, threatened against Buyer which, if adversely determined, could individually or in the aggregate materially interfere with the consummation of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.  (c) There are no general assignments for the benefit of creditors, or voluntary
or involuntary proceedings in bankruptcy, existing, pending or, to the best of Buyers knowledge, threatened against Buyer. 
(d) Buyer acknowledges that as of the Satisfaction Date it will have had an adequate opportunity to inspect the Property and to
investigate its physical characteristics and conditions. Upon the Satisfaction Date, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any and all objections to the Property, if Buyer has delivered to Seller the notice of satisfaction of the Conditions as
provided in Section 4(a). Other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement and/or in the documents to be executed and delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement as of the Closing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) Buyer is
acquiring the Property in its AS IS condition, WITH ALL FAULTS, IF ANY, AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, and (ii) neither Seller nor any agents, representatives, trustees, beneficiaries or employees of Seller have made
any representations or warranties, direct or indirect, oral or written, express or implied, to Buyer or Buyers officers, directors, shareholders, representatives, partners, affiliated entities, employees or agents (collectively,
Buyers Agents) with respect to the condition of the Property, its fitness for any particular purpose, or its compliance with any laws, and Buyer is not aware of and does not rely upon any such representation. Buyer acknowledges
that the due diligence period will have afforded Buyer the opportunity to make such inspections (or have such inspections made by consultants) as it desires of the Property and all factors relevant to its use, including, without limitation, the
interior, exterior, and structure of any improvements on the Property, the condition of soils and subsurfaces, and the status of all zoning, permitting and other entitlements relevant to the use or contemplated use of the Property. Buyer
acknowledges that during the due diligence period, Buyer and Buyers agents will independently and with the assistance of its professional advisors and consultants undertake whatever studies, tests and investigation Buyer desires to conduct
relating to the Property (including, without limitation, economic reviews, soils tests, engineering analyses, pest and mold inspections, environmental analyses and analyses of the records of any governmental or quasi-governmental entity having
jurisdiction over the Property). Subject to the express representations, warranties and covenants of Seller as set forth in this Agreement and/or in the documents to be executed and delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement as of the Closing,
Buyer has entered into this Agreement based upon the opportunity to conduct such inspections. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and/or in the documents to be executed and delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement as of the Closing,
Buyer is relying   
-13- 



solely on its own investigation as to the Property and its value and is assuming the risk that adverse physical, economic or other conditions (including, without limitation, adverse environmental
conditions, mold, dry rot, termite infestation, asbestos-containing materials in the Improvements, and the status of compliance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990) may not have been revealed by such investigation.
Buyer acknowledges that if Buyer elects prior to the Due Diligence Date to continue this Agreement, Buyer agrees to purchase the Property without regard to any such condition, subject to the express representations, warranties and covenants of
Seller as set forth in this Agreement and/or in the documents to be executed and delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement as of the Closing. 
(e) Except for (1) Sellers breach of its covenants, representations or warranties in this Agreement and/or in any of the
documents to be executed and delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement as of the Closing, and (2) Sellers fraud, Buyer, on behalf of itself and Buyers Agents and successors and assigns to this Agreement (collectively, the
Releasors), hereby completely releases and forever discharges Seller and Sellers officers, board members, partners, affiliates, employees, successors, assigns, heirs, agents, and representatives from and against all claims,
liabilities, demands, judgments, damages, losses and costs (collectively, Claims) whether known or unknown which may arise from or be related to the following (collectively, the Released Matters): (i) the physical
condition, quality, quantity, and state of repair of the Property and the prior operation of the Property, (ii) the Propertys compliance or lack of compliance with any federal, state or local laws or regulations, (iii) any latent or
patent defect affecting the Property, and (iv) any past, present or future presence or existence of hazardous substances on, under or about the Property or with respect to any past, present or future violation of any Environmental Laws. In
connection with such waiver and relinquishment, Buyer acknowledges that it is aware that it hereafter may discover Claims or facts in addition to or different from those which it now knows or believes to exist with respect to the Released Matters,
but that it is its intention to fully, finally and forever to settle and release all of the Released Matters on behalf of the Releasors in accordance with the provisions of this Section 16(e), and the release set forth herein shall be and
remain in effect as a full and complete release notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or different Claims or facts. The foregoing release of Claims shall be binding on Releasors. In connection with the release provided in
this Section 16, Buyer expressly waives the benefits of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code which provides as follows: 
A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF
EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN TO HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. 
Buyers Initials
                     
References to the best of Buyers knowledge shall refer only to the actual, present knowledge of David Thomas (the
Buyers Knowledge Party), as of the Effective Date and as of the Closing Date, without any duty of inquiry or investigation. Buyer and Seller acknowledge 
 
-14- 



that the Buyers Knowledge Party shall have no personal liability for the representations and warranties made in this Section 16 or elsewhere in this Agreement. 
The representations and warranties in Section 16 shall survive the Closing Date for a period of one (1) year. 
17. Default and Remedies. 
(a) Except for the Parties obligations under Section 11 which must be performed prior to the Closing, in the event of any default,
the non-defaulting Party shall give the defaulting Party written notice of the occurrence of such default (a Default Notice) and the defaulting Party shall have ten (10) days following its receipt of such Default Notice in which to
cure such default hereunder.  (b) IN THE EVENT THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY AS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER IS NOT CONSUMMATED DUE TO A
DEFAULT OF BUYER AFTER THE SATISFACTION DATE, THE EARNEST MONEY (TO THE EXTENT PREVIOUSLY PAID BY BUYER TO ESCROW HOLDER, INCLUDING ALL INTEREST EARNED FROM THE INVESTMENT THEREOF) SHALL BE RELEASED TO SELLER AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. THE PARTIES
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SELLERS ACTUAL DAMAGES IN THE EVENT THAT THE SALE IS NOT CONSUMMATED WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE. THEREFORE, BY SEPARATELY EXECUTING THIS SECTION 17(a) BELOW, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE
EARNEST MONEY MADE BY BUYER ON OR BEFORE THE DATE OF BUYERS DEFAULT HAS BEEN AGREED UPON, AFTER NEGOTIATION, AS THE PARTIES REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLERS DAMAGES, AND AS SELLERS EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST BUYER IN THE EVENT OF
BUYERS DEFAULT HEREUNDER AND THAT IF THE CLOSING DOES NOT OCCUR AS A RESULT THEREOF, AS SELLERS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST BUYER ARISING FROM SUCH FAILURE OF THE SALE TO CLOSE DUE TO DEFAULT BY BUYER (SELLER HEREBY WAIVING ANY
RIGHT TO SEEK DAMAGES, TO SUE FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OR PURSUE ANY OTHER REMEDIES HEREUNDER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 17(b) BELOW). BY THEIR SEPARATELY EXECUTING THIS SECTION 17(b) BELOW, BUYER AND SELLER
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE ABOVE PROVISION COVERING LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, AND THAT EACH PARTY WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL WHO EXPLAINED THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION AT THE TIME THIS AGREEMENT WAS
EXECUTED. SELLER HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL BENEFITS IT MAY HAVE UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 3389. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, OR ANY OTHER PROVISION TO THE CONTRARY, THIS SECTION 17(b) SHALL IN NO WAY LIMIT OR RESTRICT SELLERS
RECOVERY UNDER SECTION 4(c), SECTION 19, SECTION 20, or SECTION 23 HEREOF.  BUYER:
                                SELLER:
                       
-15- 


(c) In the event that the Closing does not occur as a result of a breach of any of
Sellers covenants, representations, warranties or other obligations under this Agreement, then Buyer shall have as its sole and exclusive remedy the right to either (i) terminate this Agreement and to receive a return of the Earnest Money
together with an additional sum from Seller equal to Buyers actual, documented a out-of-pocket third party costs and expenses in connection with this transaction but in no event in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), or
(ii) seek the remedy of specific performance to enforce Sellers obligation to convey title to the Property to Buyer in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If Buyer elects remedy (i) in the preceding sentence,
Buyer shall direct Title Company to record or release to Seller the quitclaim deed described in Section 18, below.  (d)
Notwithstanding Section 17(b) and Section 17(c) hereof, in no event shall such provisions limit the damages recoverable by either Party against the other Party due to the other Partys obligation to indemnify such Party in accordance
with this Agreement.  18. Memorandum of Agreement. Promptly upon Buyers request, the Seller agrees to execute a
Memorandum of this Agreement, in recordable form, and substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D; provided that Buyer delivers to the Title Company to be held in escrow an executed and notarized quitclaim deed to Seller terminating
its rights under the Memorandum of this Agreement. Title Company shall be permitted to record, or release such quitclaim deed to Seller for recording, against the Property if this Agreement is terminated for any reason except Sellers default,
as set forth in Section 17(c), above. Buyer shall have the right to cause Title Company to record such Memorandum at Buyers expense, including transfer or recording taxes, if any. Seller also agrees to execute such transfer tax
declarations or similar documentation as may be required to facilitate such recording.  19. Use of Brokers. Seller and
Buyer hereby warrant that neither Party has an obligation to pay an outside brokerage commission for the sale of the Property. Buyer and Seller hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from and against any liability, cost
or expense, plus all costs of collection, including litigation expenses and attorneys fees, as a result of a claim for a commission, fee or other compensation made by any real estate broker, finder or other person and asserted against the
other Party by reason of an arrangement made or alleged to have been made by the indemnifying Party.  20. Attorneys
Fees. In the event that either Party shall bring an action or legal proceeding for an alleged breach of any provision of this Agreement or any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein set forth, or to enforce, protect, determine or
establish any term, covenant or provision of this Agreement or the rights hereunder of either Party, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing Party, as a part of such action or proceedings, or in a separate action
brought for that purpose, reasonable attorneys fees and costs, expert witness fees and court costs as may be fixed by the court or jury. 
21. Binding Effect. This Agreement is executed by Buyer and submitted to Seller as an offer to purchase the Property. If:
(i) Seller does not execute and deliver this Agreement, without revision, to Buyer within five (5) business days after the date of Buyers execution of this Agreement, Buyers offer shall terminate and expire; or (ii) in the
event Buyer delivers written   
-16- 



notice to Seller within such period, revoking its offer to purchase; in either event, Buyer shall have no further liability or obligation hereunder. 
22. Confidentiality. The terms of this Agreement, the results of any tests and inspections performed by or on behalf of Buyer, and
any information provided or made available by Seller pursuant to Section 7, above, shall be kept and maintained confidential and shall not be disclosed by either Party to any third party without the prior written consent of the other Party.
This provision shall not prohibit disclosures on a need to know basis to employees, agents, attorneys, brokers, surveyors, title companies, engineers, contractors, lenders, etc., as necessary to obtain financing or governmental permits
and approvals, to potential tenants, or as compelled by legal process or required by law. This provision shall survive any termination of this Agreement, but shall not survive the close of escrow. Sellers additional non-circumvention
obligation is set forth in Section 25, below.  23. Section 1031 Exchange. In the event that either Party
elects to structure this transaction as a like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code, the other Party shall reasonably cooperate upon the request of the electing Party, including prompt execution of such documents as may reasonably
be required to effectuate such exchange, provided that: (a) the electing Party shall bear all costs in connection with such exchange and shall indemnify and hold the other Party harmless from and against any cost, claims, expenses or
liabilities (including attorneys fees) incurred by the other Party solely as a result of structuring the transaction as a like-kind exchange; and (b) the exchange shall have no material effect on the terms of either Partys rights or
obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Seller agrees that Buyer may assign its rights in this Agreement to a third party as part of any such exchange. Nothing contained herein shall
prevent both Parties from electing a like-kind exchange.  24. Force Majeure. Except with regard to the payment of money
due, if either Party hereto shall be delayed, hindered in, or prevented from the performance of its obligations hereunder by reason of any occurrence which is not within the reasonable anticipation or control of such Party, including but not limited
to strikes, lockouts, labor troubles, governmental action or inaction, failure of power, riots, insurrection, war, acts of God, or other similar reason, and which occurrence, in any event, is not a result of the intentional act, negligence or
willful misconduct of such Party (a Force Majeure Event), such Partys performance shall be excused for the period of time equivalent to the delay caused by such Force Majeure Event, provided such Party gives prompt notice to the
other Party of such delay.  25. Miscellaneous Provisions. 
(a) This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced according to the laws of the State of California, without reference to its conflict
of laws rules. The venue of any litigation arising out of this Agreement shall lie exclusively with the state or federal court in whose district the Property is located. 
(b) All headings and section designations of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not form a part of this Agreement or
limit, expand or otherwise alter the meaning of any provisions hereof.   
-17- 


(c) This Agreement, and any amendments hereto, may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same document. The Parties agree that, except for notices (which are governed by Section 14, above), signatures transmitted by facsimile or
scanned and emailed shall have the legal effect of original signatures. At the request of either Party, the Parties shall promptly exchange executed original counterparts of this Agreement or any amendment. 
(d) The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be for the sole benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns,
and none of the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be, nor shall they be construed to be, for the benefit of any third party. 
(e) If, under any provision of this Agreement: (i) the date any act to be done or action to be taken; or (ii) the last day of
any time period, including any notice period; falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state whose law governs this Agreement, then such act or action shall be deemed to have been validly done or taken on, or such time period shall be
deemed extended to, the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, and all succeeding time periods shall be deemed extended accordingly. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all references herein to a
day or days shall refer to calendar days.  (f) Buyer may assign this Agreement and all of its
interests herein to an entity related to Buyer or affiliated with Buyer. Upon any assignment, the assignee shall have and be subject to all the rights, benefits, duties and obligations of Buyer hereunder, but the Buyer shall not be released from any
of its obligations under this Agreement.  (g) This Agreement represents the entire agreement between Seller and Buyer covering
everything agreed upon or understood in this transaction. There are no oral promises, conditions, representations, understandings, interpretations or terms of any kind as conditions or inducements to the execution hereof or in effect between the
Parties. No change or addition shall be made to this Agreement except by a written agreement duly executed by Seller and Buyer. 
(h) The Parties acknowledge that each has been represented by, or has had the opportunity to consult with, legal counsel of its own
choosing in this matter, and this Agreement has been arrived at through arms length negotiation. For purposes of the rule of contract interpretation that construes a document against its drafter, the Parties agree that neither Party nor its
counsel shall be considered the drafter hereof.  (i) If any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement is held to be
invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with its intent as if such invalid or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein.  (j) No failure by either Party, at any time, to require the performance by the other of any term of
this Agreement, shall in any way affect the right of either Party to enforce such terms, nor shall any waiver by either Party of any term hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. No waiver of any term or
provision of this   
-18- 



Agreement shall be effective unless the same is in writing and signed by the Party granting such waiver. 
(k) Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that, subject to any provisions hereof to the contrary, it is a legal entity duly organized,
existing in good standing and qualified to do business in the State of California. At the time of Closing, Buyer or its assignee shall be an entity duly organized, existing in good standing and qualified to do business in the state where the
Property is located. Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that: it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to assume and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement; and the person executing this Agreement on its
behalf has been duly authorized and is empowered to bind it to this Agreement.  (l) Seller represents and warrants to Buyer
that: subject to any provisions hereof to the contrary, it is a legal entity duly organized and existing in good standing, and is qualified to do business in the state where the Property is located; it has full power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to assume and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement; and the person executing this Agreement on its behalf has been duly authorized and is empowered to bind it to this Agreement. If any Seller is an individual, that Party
represents and warrants that he or she shall take such steps as are necessary to convey his or her interest in the Property free and clear of all marital or homestead rights of his or her spouse. 
(m) The parties to this Agreement shall in good faith undertake to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement, to satisfy
all conditions for which they are responsible, and to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be carried out in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In that regard, the Parties agree to promptly execute such other documents
and to perform such other acts as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement. Concerning all matters in this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of either Party, the Parties agree that any such consent
or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement. 
(n) All Exhibits to this Agreement are incorporated herein as though fully set forth. 
(o) Buyer acknowledges that the Disclosure Statutes (hereinafter defined) require that a seller of real property in California must make
certain disclosures regarding certain natural hazards potentially affecting the property, as more particularly provided therein. As used in this Agreement, Disclosure Statutes means, collectively, California Government Code Sections
8589.3, 8589.4 and 51183.5, California Public Resources Code Sections 2621.9, 2694 and 4136 and any other California statutes that require Seller to make disclosures concerning the Property. Seller will deliver to Buyer a Natural Hazard Disclosure
Report for the Property in accordance with the foregoing statutes (the Report). Buyer hereby agrees as follows with respect to the Disclosure Statutes and the Report: (i) that the delivery of the Report to Buyer as provided above
shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations and requirements of Seller under the Disclosure Statutes; (ii) that Seller shall not be liable for any error or inaccuracy in, or omission from, the information in the Report; (iii) that the
Report was provided by Seller for purposes of complying with the Disclosure Statutes and shall not be deemed to constitute a representation or 
 
-19- 



warranty by Seller as to the presence or absence in, at or around the Property of the conditions that are the subject of the Disclosure Statutes; and (iv) the Report is for Seller and Buyer
only and is not for the benefit of, or to be used for any purpose by, any other party, including, without limitation, insurance companies, lenders, or governmental agencies. 
(p) Following the Closing Date and in connection with Buyers negotiation of a lease with a major tenant of all or a portion of the
Property, Buyer may elect to modify the off-ramp and change the street name from Zhone Way. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyers efforts to so modify the off-ramp and change the street name from Zhone Way. Sellers obligations set forth
in this section shall survive the close of escrow and shall not be merged with the recordation of the grant deed.  [End of text

Property Address: 6775, 7195 and 7001 Oakport Street, Oakland, Alameda County, California, 
Deposit Amount: $1,000,000.00 
LBA RIV-COMPANY V, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Buyer), and ZHONE TECHNOLOGIES CAMPUS, LLC, a California
limited liability company (the Seller), are parties to that certain Real Estate Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) dated as of             , 2010, with
respect to the above referenced property (the Property), which is more particularly described in the Agreement. The Buyer has deposited the sum of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the Deposit) with First American Title
Insurance Company (the Title Company) to be held under the terms of the Agreement and the terms of this Escrow Agreement (the Escrow Agreement). Prior to the Satisfaction Date (as defined in the Agreement), or if the
Satisfaction Date has not occurred by the Due Diligence Date (as defined in the Agreement), the Deposit shall be refunded by the Title Company to the Buyer upon receipt of a written request from the Buyer, together with evidence that the Buyer has
given the Seller written notice of termination in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, or that the Due Diligence Date has occurred. Following the Satisfaction Date (or following the Due Diligence Date, if the Title Company has not received
any written request from the Buyer as set forth above), the Earnest Money (as defined in the Agreement) shall be held in escrow by the Title Company and delivered only upon the joint written order of the Buyer and Seller or their respective legal
representatives or assigns, except as otherwise specifically provided herein; and the Buyer and Seller each agree to give such written orders to the Title Company in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. 
Following the Satisfaction Date, the Title Company is hereby expressly authorized to disregard, in its sole discretion, any and all
unilateral notices or warnings given by any of the parties hereto, or by any other person or corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, but Title Company is hereby expressly authorized to regard and to comply with and obey any and
all orders, judgments or decrees entered or issued by any court with or without jurisdiction, and in case Title Company obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or any
other person, firm or corporation by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being entered without jurisdiction or being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated. In case of any suit or
proceeding regarding this escrow, to which Title Company is or may at any time become a party, it shall have a lien on the contents hereof for any and all costs, attorneys fees, whether such attorneys shall be regularly retained or specially
employed, and any other expenses which it may have incurred or become liable for on account thereof, and it shall be entitled to reimburse itself therefor out of said deposit, and the undersigned jointly and severally agree to pay Title Company upon
demand all such costs, fees and expenses so incurred.   
EXHIBIT B

Except as expressly provided herein, in no case shall the above mentioned deposits be
surrendered except on an order signed by the parties hereto, their respective legal representatives or assigns, or in obedience of the process or order of court as aforesaid. 
Unless directed otherwise in writing by Buyer, all deposits made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement shall be invested on behalf of the
Buyer in investments limited to interest-bearing, federally-insured instruments with a national bank or federal savings bank or in a money market fund authorized to invest solely in direct obligations of the United States of America (Qualified
Investments). The funds invested in this manner shall have a maturity of 30 days or less. Interest and other earnings on any funds invested hereunder shall be added to the funds held on deposit by Title Company hereunder, and losses, if any,
incurred from any such investment shall reduce the balance of the funds on deposits hereunder. Buyer shall provide Title Company with its taxpayer identification number and such investment forms as it may reasonably require. Title Company shall,
upon request furnish information concerning its procedures for such investment, but shall not charge or otherwise assess any additional fees for the investment of such funds. 
Billing Instructions: Escrow fee in the amount of $0.00 will be billed as follows: Half to Seller and half to Buyer. NOTE  ESCROW
FEES WAIVED IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE TITLE COMPANY WILL BE PROVIDING TITLE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENT FOR WHICH IT WILL BE COMPENSATED AT CLOSING. 
Except as to deposits of funds for which Title Company has received express written direction concerning investment to other handling,
the parties hereto agree that the Title Company shall be under no duty to invest or reinvest any deposits at any time held by it thereunder; and, further that Title Company may commingle such deposits with other deposits or with its own funds in the
manner provided for the administration of funds held as a fiduciary under applicable law, provided, however, nothing herein shall diminish Title Companys obligation to apply the full amount of the deposits in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement.  In the event the Title Company is requested to invest deposits hereunder in Qualified Investments pursuant to this
agreement, Title Company shall not be held responsible for any loss of principal or interest which may be incurred as a result of making the investments or redeeming said investment for the purposes of these escrow instructions except to the extent
that Title Company negligently or willfully fails to follow such investment directions.  This Escrow Agreement is intended to
be executed in triplicate, but may be executed in multiple counterparts. Each such counterpart shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same document. The parties agree that, except for notice purposes,
signatures transmitted by facsimile or scanned and e-mailed shall have the legal effect of original signatures. Upon the request of any party, the parties shall promptly exchange executed original counterparts of this Escrow Agreement.
