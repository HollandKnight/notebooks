REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
THIS REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this Agreement) is entered into as of the
26th day of March, 2010 (the Effective Date),
by and between LD Lyndon Properties, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Seller), and BC DEVELOPMENT CO., LLC, a Missouri limited liability company or its assigns (Buyer), for the purchase of certain real property more
particularly described herein.  ARTICLE 1 
SALE OF PROPERTY 
1.1 Property To Be Sold. Subject to the terms and provisions hereof, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer and Buyer agrees to purchase
from Seller upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement:  1.1.1 All of the land described and/or shown on
Exhibit A attached hereto, together with all privileges, rights, easements and appurtenances belonging to such land, including without limitation, all right, title and interest (if any) of Seller in and to any streets,
alleys, passages, usufructs and other rights-of-way or appurtenances included in, adjacent to or used in connection with such land and all right, title and interest (if any) of Seller in all mineral and development rights appurtenant to such land
(collectively, the Land).  1.1.2 All buildings, structures and other improvements and all fixtures,
systems and facilities located on the Land (the Improvements).  1.1.3 All equipment, machinery,
signs and other tangible personal property of every kind and nature, if any, owned by Seller and installed, located or situated on or used in connection with the operation of the Land or Improvements, including, without limitation, the personal
property listed on Exhibit B attached hereto (the Personal Property). Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are no specific items of Personal Property located on the Land or Improvements that would not otherwise be
considered fixtures.  1.1.4 All of Sellers rights in the lease and any other occupancy
agreement covering any portion of the Land or Improvements (the Lease), including the lease listed on the attached Exhibit C and any leases that may be subsequently entered into in accordance with this Agreement,
and including Sellers rights to any tenant deposit held by Seller (the Tenant Deposit) pursuant to the Leases. 
1.1.5 All of Sellers right, title and interest, if any, in all intangible assets of any nature relating to the Land,
the Improvements or the Personal Property, including, without limitation, all of Sellers right, title, and interest in all (i) warranties and guaranties relating to the Improvements or Personal Property in the possession of Seller,
(ii) all use, occupancy, building and operating licenses, permits, approvals, and development rights (iii) any trade name or names used or utilized in connection with the Land and Improvements, including without limitation the trade name
Charles Wilson VA Outpatient Clinic, (iv) all plans and specifications related to the Land and Improvements, in each case to the extent that Seller may legally transfer the same (the Intangible Property). 
 
1 


1.1.6 All of Sellers rights, if any, in all service contracts (other
than management and leasing contracts) affecting the Land or Improvements as set forth on Exhibit D attached hereto (the Property Contracts), to the extent Buyer assumes the same in accordance with Section 3.4
below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are no written Property Contracts connected with the Land or Improvements. Any agreements for services connected with the Land or Improvements are oral in nature and are in place from
month-to-month.  1.1.7 All rights, which the Seller may have, if any, in and to any tenant data,
telephone numbers and listings, all master keys and keys to common areas, all good will, if any, and any and all other rights, privileges and appurtenances owned by Seller and related to or used in connection with the existing business operation of
the Land and Improvements (the Miscellaneous Property).  1.1.8 The Land and Improvements are
hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the Real Property and the Real Property, Personal Property, Leases, Tenant Deposits, Intangible Property, the Property Contracts and the Miscellaneous Property, are hereinafter sometimes
referred to collectively as the Property.  1.2 Purchase and Sale. Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller and
Seller agrees to sell to Buyer all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Property, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
1.3 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Property (the Purchase Price) shall be Six Million Four Hundred Fifty
Thousand and 00/100s Dollars ($6,450,000.00). The Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller by Buyer on the Closing Date (as defined below), plus or minus all adjustments or credits as set forth herein, by wire transfer of immediately available federal
funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price was determined based on a projected net operating income (NOI) of Five Hundred Thirty-Three Thousand Nine Hundred Eighty-Nine and no/100 Dollars
($533,989.00), and thus a capitalization rate of 8.28% (Capitalization Rate), being achieved during the first year of the term of the Lease. If it is determined that the NOI for the first year of the term of the Lease was different than
Five Hundred Thirty-Three Thousand Nine Hundred Eighty-Nine and no/100 Dollars ($533,989.00), the Purchase Price will be re-calculated to reflect the same Capitalization Rate based upon the actual first year NOI. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the determination of the actual NOI for the first year of the term of the Lease shall be a condition precedent to Closing. 
1.4 Deposit. Within one (1) Business Day after the Effective Date, Buyer shall deliver to Chicago Title Insurance
Corporation, 830 East Main Street, Suite 1600, Richmond, VA 23219, Attn: Chris Newman (Escrow Holder), a good faith deposit in the amount of Thirty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($30,000.00) (the Initial Deposit), and within
one (1) business day following the end of the Due Diligence Period (defined below in Section 3.2), assuming Buyer has not previously terminated this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to Escrow Holder an additional good faith deposit
(Additional Deposit) of Thirty Thousand and 00/100   
2 



Dollars ($30,000.00). The Initial Deposit and the Additional Deposit shall be collectively referred to as the Deposit. The Deposit shall be held in an insured, interest-bearing account with
interest accruing for the benefit of Buyer. The Deposit (including any interest thereon) shall be applied to the Purchase Price if the Closing occurs. After the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, the Deposit shall be nonrefundable to Buyer
unless escrow fails to close due to Sellers breach or default under this Agreement, there is a failure of a representation or warranty by Seller to be true and correct as of the Closing, there is a failure of a condition precedent set forth in
Section 5.4, there is a casualty or condemnation, or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, and shall constitute liquidated damages to Seller if escrow fails to close solely as a result of Buyers default as provided in
Section 6.1 below. In the event Buyer shall elect to terminate this Agreement during the Due Diligence Period, the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer as provided in Section 3.5 below. 
1.5 Closing Date. 
1.5.1 The Closing (as defined in Section 5.3 below) shall take place through an escrow opened with Escrow Holder on
or before the date (the Closing Date) which is the later of i) July 30, 2010 or (ii) at such other place and on such other date as Seller and Buyer mutually agree, but in any event the parties agree the Closing must occur, if
at all, before August 15, 2010. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Closing occur earlier than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Date, unless Buyer shall have expressly waived
this contingency in a separately executed written document. Seller may extend the date of Closing, in its sole and absolute discretion, provided (i) that the Closing occurs no later than August 15, 2010 and (ii) that Seller notifies
Buyer in writing of its election to extend Closing no later than July 15, 2010 and (iii) that Sellers notice of its election to extend Closing provides Buyer a date certain by which Closing will occur. 
1.5.2 Intentionally Omitted. 
ARTICLE 2 
TITLE AND SURVEY 
2.1 Title and Survey. During the Due Diligence Period, Buyer, at Buyers cost and expense, may obtain a preliminary title
report or commitment (the Preliminary Report) from Chicago Title Insurance Corporation (the Title Company), together with legible copies of all recorded encumbrances and exceptions to title, no later than seven
(7) Business Days after the Effective Date, as well as an existing survey, if any, from Seller. Buyer shall, at its option and at its expense, (i) conduct UCC searches covering Seller and the Property (the UCC Searches) and
(ii) order an update of the existing survey of the Real Property by a licensed surveyor or registered professional engineer (the Survey). 
2.2 Review of the Preliminary Report, Survey and UCC Searches; Objection; Approval or Termination. On or before the last day of
the Due Diligence Period, with respect to the Preliminary Report or within ten (10) days after delivery of any supplement to the Preliminary Title Report (Supplemental Report), Buyer may deliver to Seller a notice (the Title
Objection Notice) setting forth (i) any matters shown on the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey or UCC Searches to which Buyer objects and requires be 
 
3 



eliminated, (ii) any modifications, supplements or other modifications of the legal description, description of exceptions or other matters set forth in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental
Report or Survey, and (iii) any endorsements or other affirmative title insurance coverage required to be included in the Title Policy (collectively, clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) herein shall be referred to hereinafter as the
Title Objections). Buyer may make its determination of whether any of the matters contained in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey or UCC Searches (as applicable) are appropriate or are objectionable in its sole
discretion. Buyers failure to give the Title Objection Notice shall be deemed to constitute Buyers disapproval of matters disclosed in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey, or UCC Searches (as applicable) and this
Agreement shall terminate. If Buyer delivers a Title Objection Notice, Seller shall have seven (7) Business Days from the receipt of Buyers notice to provide Buyer with written notice of Sellers election to remove or otherwise cure
to Buyers reasonable satisfaction the Title Objections prior to the Closing (Seller Response Notice); provided however, and notwithstanding Buyers inclusion or lack thereof in any Title Objection Notice, Seller shall be
obligated to eliminate all monetary liens or encumbrances, and any exceptions created or consented to by Seller after the Effective Date, unless approved in writing by Buyer, which Seller shall cause to be released at Closing. If Seller timely
delivers notice of election not to cure a disapproved item, then Buyer may either (i) elect to terminate this Agreement, or (ii) waive in writing its prior disapproval of such item and accept title subject to such previously disapproved
item by delivering notice of Buyers election to Seller within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of the Seller Response Notice. If Seller fails to timely deliver the Seller Response Notice within such seven (7) Business Day
period, then Seller shall be deemed to have elected to cure all of the disapproved matters set forth in Buyers Title Objection Notice. If Buyer fails to deliver its notice of election to terminate this Agreement or waive its prior disapproval
within such five (5) day business period following Sellers Response Notice, Buyer shall be deemed to have disapproved of Sellers Response Notice and this Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
this Section 2.2, the provisions of Section 3.5 shall apply.  2.3 Required Title Condition. Title to the
Property shall be conveyed to Buyer subject only to the following permitted encumbrances: (a) current, non-delinquent real estate taxes and assessments, (B) the matters set forth in the Preliminary Report and permitted as part of the
Required Title Condition, (c) the Leases, and (d) any other matters approved in writing by Buyer.  ARTICLE 3 
 INSPECTION AND DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD 
3.1 Access. From and after the Effective Date through the Closing, Buyer, personally or through its authorized agent or
representatives, shall be entitled, upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, to enter upon the Property during normal business hours and shall have the right to make such investigations, including tenant interviews, appraisals, engineering studies,
soil tests, environmental studies and underwriting analyses, as Buyer deems reasonably necessary or advisable. Buyer shall have the right to conduct a Phase I environmental site assessment, and, if necessary, a Phase II environmental site assessment
(including soils borings, soil sampling and, if relevant, ground water testing, and invasive sampling of building materials with respect to the Property). Buyers activities at the Property shall be conducted in such a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with the occupancy of the tenant or its employees, licensees or invitees. Regarding Buyers investigations, in addition to the forgoing: 
a. Buyer must deliver evidence to Seller that Buyer has insurance for its proposed inspection activities, in amounts and with coverages
that are substantially the same as those maintained by Seller or in such lesser amounts or with such lesser coverages as are reasonably satisfactory to Seller;   
4 


b. Buyer must notify Seller in advance of Buyers plans to conduct tests so that Seller
may be present during the tests;  c. if the Land or Improvements are altered because of Buyers inspections, Buyer must
return the Land or Improvements to their pre-inspection condition promptly after the alteration occurs;  d. Buyer must deliver
to Seller copies of all inspection reports that Buyer prepares or receives from third-party consultants or contractors within three days after their preparation or receipt; 
e. Buyer must abide by any other reasonable entry rules imposed by Seller; 
f. Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold Seller harmless from any loss, reasonable attorneys fees, expenses, or claims arising out
of Buyers investigation of the Land or Improvements, except repair or remediation of existing conditions discovered by Buyers inspections. The obligations of Buyer under this provision will survive termination of this Agreement and
Closing; and  g. Buyer releases Seller and those persons acting on Sellers behalf from all claims and causes of action
(including claims for attorneys fees and court and other costs) resulting from Buyers investigation of the Land or Improvements. 
3.2 Due Diligence Period. Buyer shall have sixty (60) days from the later of (i) the delivery of all of the Property
Information (defined in Section 3.3 below) and (ii) the Effective Date of this Agreement (the Due Diligence Period) to physically inspect the Property, review the economic data, underwrite the tenants and review the Leases,
conduct appraisals, perform examinations of the physical condition of the Improvements, examine the Property for the presence of Hazardous Materials (as defined below), and to otherwise conduct such due diligence review of the Property and all of
the items to be furnished by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3 below, and all records and other materials related thereto as Buyer deems appropriate. 
3.3 Items to be Provided by Seller. No later than one (1) Business Day after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer (by electronic or overnight delivery) accurate and complete copies of all of the information set forth on Exhibit G attached hereto and incorporated herein (Property Information). In addition to the foregoing
deliveries, Seller shall make available to Buyer for inspection and copying at Sellers offices in Lufkin, Texas the   
5 



originals of any of the Property Information and any and all other documents, instruments, studies, reports, surveys, maps, files, correspondence (including without limitation, tenant
correspondence files), reports and other materials related to the Property and not included in the Property Information. Seller agrees to update, provide and make available to Buyer new Property Information as it becomes available. Where financial
statements are required, Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to have its auditor, BDO Seidman, LLP, or another qualified auditor of Buyers choosing conduct an audit of the property financial
statements and other information. Where financial statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP), to the extent Seller does not have such financial statements, Buyer shall have the right
(but not the obligation), at its sole cost and expense, to have its accountants prepare Sellers financial statements in accordance with GAAP. 
3.4 Buyers Possible Early Termination. Buyer shall have the right to approve in Buyers sole and absolute discretion,
the Property, the Property Information, the Preliminary Report, any Supplemental Report, the Survey, the UCC Searches, or any other matter whatsoever regarding the Property. On or before the last day of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall provide
written notice (Approval Notice) to Seller and Escrow Holder that Buyer has approved the Property. Buyers failure to provide an Approval Notice upon the expiration of the Due Diligence Period shall be deemed disapproval of the
Property. At any time prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer may provide written notice to Seller and Escrow Holder disapproving the Property (Disapproval Notice). Upon the giving of a Disapproval Notice or the deemed
disapproval of the Property, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and the provisions of Section 3.5 shall apply.  
3.5 Consequences of Buyers Early Termination. Upon the giving of a Disapproval Notice or upon deemed disapproval pursuant to
Section 2.2 or Section 3.5, this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and the parties shall be released from all further obligations under this Agreement (except with respect to any provisions that by their terms survive a termination of
this Agreement); provided, however, that if Seller is in default hereunder at the time of such termination, Section 6.2 shall additionally apply. Provided Buyer is not then in default under the terms of this Agreement, Escrow Holder shall pay
the entire Deposit to Buyer not later than one (1) Business Day following receipt of Buyers Disapproval Notice (as long as the then-current investment of the Deposit can be liquidated in one (1) Business Day). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in any event, Escrow Holder will obtain the written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, of both Seller and Buyer before releasing the Deposit to either party. 
ARTICLE 4

6 



The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all documents contemplated hereby by Seller have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller and
all required consents and approvals have been duly obtained and will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any indenture, agreement or instrument to which Seller is a party. This Agreement is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally.  4.1.2 Seller has good and marketable title to the Property. There are no outstanding
rights of first refusal, rights of reverter or options to purchase relating to the Property or any interest therein. To Sellers knowledge, there are no unrecorded or undisclosed documents or other matters which affect title to the Property.
Subject to the Leases, Seller has enjoyed the continuous and uninterrupted quiet possession, use and operation of the Property, without material complaint or objection by any person. 
4.1.3 Seller is not a foreign person within the meaning of Section 1445(f) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the Code).  4.1.4 Neither Seller nor any of its affiliates, nor any of their
respective partners, members, shareholders or other equity owners, and none of their respective employees, officers, directors, representatives or agents is, nor will they become, a person or entity with whom United States persons or entities are
restricted from doing business under regulations of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury (including those named on OFACs Specially Designated and Blocked Persons List) or under any statute,
executive order (including, without limitation, the September 24, 2001, Executive Order Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism), or other governmental action, and is not
and will not engage in any dealings or transactions or be otherwise associated with such persons or entities. 
4.1.5 The authorization, consent, and approval of a governmental authority is required for the Closing herein described to
occur. However, Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval within fifteen (15) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement. 
4.1.6 There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the best of Sellers knowledge, threatened
(a) affecting Seller, which if determined adversely, would affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder; or (b) against any portion of the Property. 
4.1.7 Seller has not (a) made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (b) filed any voluntary
petition in bankruptcy or suffered the filing of an involuntary petition by Sellers creditors, (c) suffered the appointment of a receiver to take possession of all or substantially all of Sellers assets, (d) suffered the
attachment or other judicial seizure of all, or substantially all, of Sellers assets, (e) admitted in writing its inability to pay its debts as they come due, or (f) made an offer of settlement, extension or composition to its
creditors generally.   
7 


4.1.8 To the best of Sellers knowledge, neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement nor compliance herewith (a) conflicts or will conflict with or results or will result in a breach of or constitutes or will constitute a default under (i) the articles of incorporation and by-laws
or other organization certificate and/or partnership or operating agreement of Seller, or (ii) any law or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority, or (b) results in the creation or imposition of any
lien, charge or encumbrance upon its property pursuant to any such agreement or instrument.  4.1.9 Seller has
not entered into any material commitments or agreements with any governmental authorities or agencies affecting the Property except as provided in the Property Information. 
4.1.10 There is no pending, threatened or contemplated condemnation proceeding relating to the Property to the best of
Sellers knowledge, and Seller has received no written notice from any governmental agency or official to the effect that any such proceeding is contemplated. 
4.1.11 Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer a complete copy of the Lease and other occupancy agreements
affecting the Property. The Lease is in full force and effect. Seller is landlord or lessor under and is entitled to assign to Buyer, without tenants consent (subject to Section 4.1.5, above), the Lease at Closing.
Neither Seller nor the tenant shall be in default under the Lease and at Closing there will exist no condition or circumstance or written notice of any condition or circumstance which, with the passage of time, would constitute a default of either
Seller or the tenant. The tenant is not asserting any claim of offset or other defense in respect of its or Sellers obligations under the Lease, and there are no unresolved disputes relating to the calculation of additional rent under the
Lease. There are no pending or incomplete tenant improvements and unpaid tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions with respect to the Lease and no pecuniary obligation to tenant and brokers has vested or accrued and is owed by Seller, except
that shall be fully completed and paid in full prior to Closing.  4.1.12 The financial statements of Property
operations provided by Seller, including, but not limited to, statements of revenue and expenses, balance sheets and statements of cash flow are true, correct and complete in all material respects. Such financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the information contained therein for the periods indicated therein. All expenses associated with Property operations have been recorded in Sellers general ledger. Seller agrees to provide such other reasonable information
requested by Buyer provided such request may not delay the Closing.  4.1.13 Seller agrees to make such further
and other reasonable representations and warranties regarding the financial statements of the Property and the Seller, including, but not limited to representations and warranties related to statements of revenue and expenses, and Sellers
internal controls for the prevention and detection of fraud, as may be reasonably required of Seller by Buyers auditor. Seller further agrees to reasonably cooperate with Buyers auditor in connection with delivery of any audit opinions
or comfort letters relating to audited financial statements prepared by Buyers Auditor and consents to the dissemination of any such audited financial statements, opinions or letters as may be required by Buyer or its auditor for any purpose,
including but not limited to their inclusion in any registration statements, prospectuses, or similar documents in connection with syndications, private placements or public offerings of securities or interest by Buyer, or any of Buyers
affiliates or assigns and any reporting requirements for the same under applicable federal and state laws. All costs and expenses associated with any reports, opinions or letters required by this section shall be borne by Buyer. 
 
8 


4.1.14 Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer true and complete
copies of all management and leasing contracts to which Seller is a party and affecting the Property and, to the best of Sellers knowledge, all other contracts, agreements, documents, reports, materials and information that are in
Sellers possession or control with respect to the ownership, use and/or operation of the Property. Seller has not, within the last year, received any written notice of any default under any Property Contract or other such contract or agreement
that has not been cured or waived.  4.1.15 There are no debts or other liabilities or obligations relating to
the Lease or the Property, including but not limited to tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions, vesting, accruing and/or arising prior to Closing which will be due or payable from or by Buyer. 
4.1.16 Seller has not received any written notice from, and is otherwise aware of no grounds for, any association,
declarant or easement holder requiring the correction of any condition with respect to the Property, or any part thereof, by reason of a violation of any restrictions or covenants recorded against the Property. 
4.1.17 Except as disclosed in the Property Information, there are no material defects in the structural elements of the
Improvements and all improvements (including, without limitation, machinery, equipment, electrical, plumbing, heating and air conditioning systems and equipment) located on the Property are in good mechanical working order, condition and repair, and
are structurally safe and sound and have no material defect (reasonable wear and tear excepted), and, there is no material leak or material defect in any roof located upon the Property. 
4.1.18 Seller has not received any written notice from, and is otherwise aware of no grounds for, any governmental agency

TERMINATION AND DEFAULT 
6.1 Buyer Default. If the sale contemplated hereby is not consummated because of a default by Buyer in its obligation to purchase

shall be paid to and retained by Seller ; (c) Buyer will reimburse Seller for Sellers actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred to perform its obligations under this Agreement (including, but not limited to, recovery of all costs and

acknowledge that the damages to Seller in the event of a breach of this Agreement by Buyer would be difficult or impossible to determine, that the amount of the deposit plus interest represents the parties best and most accurate estimate of
the damages that would be suffered by Seller if the transaction should fail to close and that such estimate is reasonable under the circumstances existing as of the date of this Agreement and under the circumstances that Seller and Buyer reasonably
anticipate would exist at the time of such breach. Buyer and Seller agree that Sellers right to retain the Deposit together with any interest and earnings earned thereon shall be Sellers sole remedy, at law and in equity, for
Buyers failure to purchase the Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Seller hereby waives any right to an action for specific performance of any provisions of this Agreement. 
6.2 Sellers Default. If prior to Closing Seller fails to perform any of its obligations or is otherwise in default
hereunder, Buyer shall have the right to exercise any or all of the following remedies:  6.2.1 Waive such
failure and proceed to the Closing with no reduction in the Purchase Price; provided, however, that this provision will not limit Buyers right to receive reimbursement for attorneys fees pursuant to Section 9.9 below in connection
with any legal proceedings instituted by either party or Escrow Holder with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement, nor waive or affect Sellers indemnity obligations under this Agreement or Buyers rights to enforce those indemnity
obligations, nor waive or affect any of Sellers other obligations under this Agreement to be performed after the Closing or Buyers rights to enforce those obligations. 
 
20

appropriate to evidence or give effect to the provisions of this Agreement and which are consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. 
9.14 Descriptive Headings; Word Meaning. The descriptive headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any provisions of this Agreement. Words such as herein, hereinafter, hereof and hereunder when used in reference to this
Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words appear, unless the context otherwise requires. The singular shall include the plural and the masculine sender shall include the feminine and neuter,

is a legal holiday in the State of Texas.  9.16 Construction of Agreement. This Agreement shall not be construed more
strictly against one party than against the other merely by virtue of the fact that it may have been prepared primarily by counsel for one of the parties, it being recognized that both Buyer and Seller have contributed substantially and materially
to the preparation of this Agreement.  9.17 Severability. The parties hereto intend and believe that each provision in
this Agreement comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions. However, if any provision in this Agreement is found by a court of law to be in violation of any applicable local, state or federal law, statute,
ordinance, administrative or judicial decision, or public policy, or if in any other respect such a court declares any such provision to be illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written, then it is the intent of all parties hereto
that, consistent with and with a view towards preserving the economic and legal arrangements among the parties hereto as expressed in this Agreement, such provision shall be given force and effect to the fullest possible extent, and that the
remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable provision were not contained herein, and that the rights, obligations and interests of the parties under the remainder of this Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect.   
24 


9.18 Exclusivity. After the Due Diligence Period, Seller and its respective agents,
representatives and employees will abate all marketing efforts for the Land and Improvements. Any existing signs may remain. Any ordered advertising will be canceled, if cancelable without penalty; otherwise ordered advertising may proceed, but no
additional advertising will occur. Brokers and prospective buyers will not be shown the Land and Improvements and will be given only currently available printed information about the Land and Improvements prepared by Sellers broker.
 9.19 Section 1031 Exchange. Either party may consummate the purchase or sale of the Property as part of a
so-called like kind exchange (an Exchange) pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code, provided that (i) the Closing shall not be delayed or affected by reason of an Exchange nor shall the consummation or accomplishment of any
Exchange be a condition precedent or condition subsequent to a partys obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any party desiring an Exchange shall effect its Exchange through an assignment of this Agreement, or its rights under this
Agreement, to a qualified intermediary and the other party shall not be required to take an assignment of the purchase agreement for the relinquished or replacement property or be required to acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes
of consummating such Exchange; and (iii) the party desiring an Exchange shall pay any additional costs that would not otherwise have been incurred by Buyer or Seller had such party not consummated its purchase or sale through an Exchange.
Neither party shall by this agreement or acquiescence to an Exchange desired by the other party (1) have its rights under this Agreement affected or diminished in any manner or (2) be responsible for compliance with or be deemed to have
warranted to the other party that such partys Exchange in fact complies with Section 1031 of the Code. In connection with such cooperation, Seller agrees, upon request of Buyer to direct deed for actual interests in the
property to designees of Buyer.  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first
written above.  [Signatures appear on the following page]

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:  1. Purchase

wire transfer of immediately available federal funds.  2. Closing Date. Section 1.5.2 of the Original Agreement is
hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:  1.5.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, until the date that is five (5) Business Days before the scheduled closing date, Buyer shall have the right to unilaterally extend the Closing Date from time to time, but in no event shall any such extension(s) extend the

cooperate such that the application for such approval may be submitted after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period. The provisions of this Section 4.4.7 shall survive the Closing. 
4. Rent Direction Letter. The following Section 5.6.11 is inserted after Section 5.6.10 of the Original Agreement:
 5.6.11 An irrevocable notice in substantially the same form as Exhibit H attached hereto, which
shall be duly executed by Seller and the depository institution in which Seller regularly deposits rents from the Property and whereby Seller instructs the depository institution to immediately disburse rents received from the Property following
Closing to an account of Buyer.  5. Exhibit H. Exhibit H attached hereto and incorporated by
reference is inserted after Exhibit G of the Original Agreement.  6. Funded Maintenance Account Proration.

parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated therein. Except as modified by this First Amendment, the Original Agreement remains unchanged and unmodified and in full force and effect, and the parties hereto hereby ratify and affirm
the same.

Irrevocable Notice for Disbursements 
Ladies and Gentlemen:  Reference is made to
that certain [Deposit Account Agreement] between [Seller Name] (Owner) and [Depository Institution] (the Bank) dated as of
                             (Account Agreement) designated account number
########### (the Account).  As you know, Owner has entered into that certain Purchase Agreement and Escrow Instructions
with BC Development Co., LLC, a Missouri limited liability company (together with its successors and assigns, the Buyer) for the purchase of certain real property owned by Owner (the Property). Owner leases the
Property to a single tenant, and the sole tenant of the Property deposits its rent payment into the Account monthly. Contemporaneously with Buyers acquisition of the Property from Owner, Owner will assign all of its rights in and to the lease
for the Property and rents received from the Property pursuant to a Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption Agreement by and between Owner and Buyer. However, the tenant under the lease may continue to make payments to the Account instead of to an
account designated by Buyer.  In order to ensure that rent payments are directed to Buyer, Owner hereby irrevocably directs Bank to disburse
funds received into the Account by Bank after the date hereof to an account designated by Buyer in writing to Bank immediately after receipt of such funds by Bank. 
Owner hereby agrees that this Letter Agreement shall be irrevocable, shall not be amended except with the prior written consent of the Buyer and shall
supersede any modification, amendment or alteration of the Account Agreement (whether executed prior to this Letter Agreement or after). No changes shall be made to the Account Agreement regarding the amount of or conditions to disbursement or any
other material terms.  The parties executing this Letter Agreement recognize and agree that Buyer is the third-party beneficiary of this
Letter Agreement. This Letter Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which is an original and all of which together constitute one document.
