1.1.5 All of Sellers right, title and interest, if any, in all intangible assets of any nature relating to the Land,
the Improvements or the Personal Property, including, without limitation, all of Sellers right, title, and interest in all (i) warranties and guaranties relating to the Improvements or Personal Property in the possession of Seller,

Property.  1.2 Purchase and Sale. Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller and Seller agrees to sell to Buyer
all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Property, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
1.3 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Property (the Purchase Price) shall collectively be Forty Four Million
Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100s Dollars ($44,500,000.00), and shall be allocated as set forth on Schedule 1.3 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller by Buyer on the Closing Date (as
defined below), plus or minus all adjustments or credits as set forth herein, by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds. 
1.4 Deposit. Within one (1) Business Day after the Effective Date, Buyer shall deliver to Chicago Title Insurance
Corporation, 5501 LBJ Freeway, Suite 200, Dallas, Texas 75240 Attn: David Long [Telephone: 214-987-6789; Facsimile: 214-987-6788; Email: david.long@cttdallas.com] (Escrow Holder), a good faith deposit in the amount of One Hundred
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) (the Initial Deposit), and within one (1)  
2 



Business Day following the end of the Due Diligence Period (defined below in Section 3.2), assuming Buyer has not previously terminated this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to Escrow Holder
an additional good faith deposit (Additional Deposit) of One Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($100,000.00). The Initial Deposit and the Additional Deposit shall be collectively referred to as the Deposit. Subject to the provisions of
Section 5.2.2 below, the Deposit shall be held in an insured, interest-bearing account with interest accruing for the benefit of Buyer. The Deposit (including any interest thereon) shall be applied to the Purchase Price if the Closing occurs.
After the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, the Deposit shall be nonrefundable to Buyer unless escrow fails to close due to Sellers breach or default under this Agreement, there is a failure of a representation or warranty by Seller to
be true and correct as of the Closing, there is a failure of a condition precedent set forth in Section 5.4, there is a casualty or condemnation, or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, and shall constitute liquidated damages to
Seller if escrow fails to close solely as a result of Buyers default as provided in Section 6.1 below. In the event Buyer shall elect to terminate this Agreement during the Due Diligence Period, the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer as
provided in Section 3.6 below.  1.5 Closing Date. 
1.5.1 The closing (Closing) shall take place through an escrow opened with Escrow Holder on such date as may
be selected by Buyer upon not less than five (5) Business Days notice to Seller, but in no event later than July 14, 2010. 
1.5.2 Buyer shall have the right to unilaterally extend the Closing Date for two additional thirty-day periods beyond the
Closing Date provided in Section 1.5.1 above. In order to exercise this right to extend the Closing Date for thirty (30) days, Buyer shall provide written notice to the Seller of its election to extend the Closing Date for up to thirty
(30) days (Closing Extension Notice) and deliver to Seller the sum of One Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($150,000.00) (the Closing Extension Deposit) not later than one (1) Business Day prior to the
originally scheduled Closing Date. If Buyer desires to extend the Closing Date for an additional thirty (30) days, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a second Closing Extension Notice and a second Closing Extension Deposit in the amount of One
Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($150,000.00) not later than one (1) Business Day prior to the first extended Closing Date. Any Extension Deposits delivered to Seller shall not be deemed part of the Deposit, but shall nevertheless be
applied to the Purchase Price if the Closing occurs. If Closing does not occur all Extension Deposits shall be retained by Seller unless the failure to close on the purchase of the Property results from either (i) Seller fails to execute and
deliver the Deeds required by Section 5.6.1; (ii) Seller fails or refuses to satisfy at Closing all outstanding mortgages and deeds of trusts encumbering the Property; or (iii) Buyer terminates this Agreement as permitted under
Article 7.  ARTICLE 2 
TITLE AND SURVEY 
2.1 Title and Survey. During the Due Diligence Period, Buyer may obtain a preliminary title report or commitment (the
Preliminary Report) from Chicago Title Insurance Corporation, 5501 LBJ Freeway, Suite 200, Dallas, Texas 75240 Attn: David Long [Telephone: 214-987-6789; 
 
3 



Facsimile: 214-987-6788; Email: david.long@cttdallas.com] (the Title Company), together with legible copies of all recorded encumbrances and exceptions to title as well as an existing
survey, if any, from Seller. Buyer may, at its option and at its expense, (i) conduct UCC searches covering Seller and the Property (the UCC Searches) and (ii) order an update of the existing survey of the Real Property by a
licensed surveyor or registered professional engineer (the Survey).  2.2 Review of the Preliminary Report,
Survey and UCC Searches; Objection; Approval or Termination. Buyer shall until April 30, 2010 to deliver to Seller a notice (the Title Objection Notice) setting forth (i) any matters shown on the Preliminary Report, to
which Buyer objects and requires be eliminated, (ii) any modifications, supplements or other modifications of any the legal description, description of exceptions or other matters set forth in the Preliminary Report, and (iii) any
endorsements or other affirmative title insurance coverage required to be included in the Title Policy (collectively, clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) herein shall be referred to hereinafter as the Title Objections). Buyer may make
its determination of whether any of the matters contained in the Preliminary Report, Survey or UCC Searches (collectively, the Title Reports) are appropriate or are objectionable in its sole discretion. Buyers failure to give the
Title Objection Notice on or before April 30, 2010 shall be deemed to constitute Buyers approval of matters disclosed in the Title Reports. If Buyer delivers a Title Objection Notice, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days from the
receipt of Buyers notice to provide Buyer with written notice of Sellers election to remove or otherwise cure to Buyers satisfaction the Title Objections prior to the Closing (Seller Response Notice); provided however,
and notwithstanding Buyers inclusion or lack thereof in any Title Objection Notice, Seller shall be obligated to eliminate all monetary liens or encumbrances, and any exceptions created or consented to by Seller or Property Owner after the
Effective Date, unless approved in writing by Buyer, which Seller shall cause to be released at Closing. If Seller timely delivers notice of election not to cure a disapproved item, then Buyer may either (i) elect to terminate this Agreement,
or (ii) waive in writing its prior disapproval of such item and accept title subject to such previously disapproved item by delivering notice of Buyers election to Seller within three (3) Business Days after the receipt of the Seller
Response Notice. If Seller fails to timely deliver the Seller Response Notice within such ten (10) Business Day period, then Seller shall be deemed to have elected not to cure all of the disapproved matters set forth in Buyers Title
Objection Notice. If Buyer fails to deliver its notice of election to terminate this Agreement or waive its prior disapproval within such three (3) day business period following Sellers Response Notice, Buyer shall be deemed to have
disapproved of Sellers Response Notice and this Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 2.2, the provisions of Section 3.6 shall apply. 
2.3 Required Title Condition. Title to the Property shall be conveyed to Buyer subject only to the following permitted
encumbrances (the Required Title Condition): (a) current, non-delinquent real estate taxes and assessments, (b) the matters set forth in the Title Reports and approved by Buyer pursuant to the terms and provisions of
Section 2.2 above, (c) the Leases, and (d) any other matters approved in writing by Buyer.

ARTICLE 3 
INSPECTION AND DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD 
3.1 Access. From and after the Effective Date through the Closing, Buyer, personally or through its authorized agent or
representatives, shall be entitled, upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, and prior approval by the tenant occupying the Property, to enter upon the Property during normal business hours and shall have the right to make such investigations,
including tenant interviews, appraisals, engineering studies, soil tests, environmental studies and underwriting analyses, as Buyer deems necessary or advisable. Buyer shall have the right to conduct a Phase I environmental site assessment, and, if
necessary, a Phase II environmental site assessment (including soils borings, soil sampling and, if relevant, ground water testing, and invasive sampling of building materials with respect to the Property). Buyers activities at the Property
shall be conducted in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the occupancy of any tenant or its employees, licensees or invitees. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Seller (and Sellers agents, advisors, partners,
members, owners, officers and directors, as the case may be) harmless from any physical damages arising out of all inspections and investigations by Buyer or its agents or independent contractors. 
3.2 Due Diligence Period. Buyer shall have the period commencing on the Effective Date of this Agreement and ending on
May 14, 2010 (the Due Diligence Period) to physically inspect the Property, review the economic data, underwrite the tenants and review the Leases, conduct appraisals, perform examinations of the physical condition of the
Improvements, examine the Property for the presence of Hazardous Materials (as defined below), and to otherwise conduct such due diligence review of the Property and all of the items to be furnished by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3
below, and all records and other materials related thereto as Buyer deems appropriate.  3.3 Items to be Provided by
Seller. No later than one (1) Business Day after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer accurate and complete copies of all of the information set forth on Exhibit G attached hereto and incorporated
herein (Property Information). In addition to the foregoing deliveries, Seller shall make available to Buyer for inspection and copying the originals of any of the Property Information and any and all other documents, instruments,
studies, reports, surveys, maps, files, correspondence (including without limitation, tenant correspondence files), reports and other materials related to the Property and not included in the Property Information. Seller agrees to update, provide
and make available to Buyer new Property Information as it becomes available to Seller. Where audited financial statements are required, to the extent Property Owner does not have audited financial statements, if so requested by Buyer, Seller shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause Property Owner to permit Buyers auditor conduct an audit of the property financial statements and other information, at Buyers sole cost and expense. Where financial statements are
required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP), to the extent Property Owner does not have such financial statements, if so requested by Buyer, Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Property Owner to permit Buyers accountants prepare Sellers financial statements in accordance with GAAP, at Buyers sole cost and expense.   
5 


3.4 Termination of Property Contracts. Seller shall have fifteen (15) days from
the Effective Date of this Agreement to notify Buyer of any Property Contracts that cannot be terminated as of the Closing Date (the Excepted Property Contracts). Prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall notify
Seller of any Property Contract which Buyer wishes to retain and assume as of the Closing. Unless otherwise expressly agreed to by Buyer, all Property Contracts, including without limitation all property management agreements and leasing agreements,
(except for the Excepted Property Contracts) shall be terminated by Seller, at Sellers expense, as of the Closing Date. 
3.5 Buyers Possible Early Termination. Buyer shall have the right to approve in Buyers sole and absolute discretion,
the Property, the Property Information, the Preliminary Report, any Supplemental Report, the Survey, the UCC Searches, or any other matter whatsoever regarding the Property. On or before the last day of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall provide
written notice (Approval Notice) to Seller and Escrow Holder that Buyer has approved the Property. Buyers failure to provide an Approval Notice upon the expiration of the Due Diligence Period shall be deemed disapproval of the
Property. At any time prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer may provide written notice to Seller and Escrow Holder disapproving the Property (Disapproval Notice). Upon the giving of a Disapproval Notice or the deemed
disapproval of the Property, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and the provisions of Section 3.6 shall apply. 
3.6 Consequences of Buyers Early Termination. Upon the giving of a Disapproval Notice or upon deemed disapproval pursuant to
Section 2.2 or Section 3.5, this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and the parties shall be released from all further obligations under this Agreement (except with respect to any provisions that by their terms survive a termination of
this Agreement); provided, however, that if Seller is in default hereunder at the time of such termination, Section 6.2 shall additionally apply. Escrow Holder shall pay the entire Deposit to Buyer not later than three (3) Business Days
following receipt of Buyers Disapproval Notice (as long as the then-current investment of the Deposit can be liquidated in three (3) Business Days). No notice to Escrow Holder from Seller shall be required for the release of the Deposit
to Buyer by Escrow Holder under this Section, and the Deposit shall be released and delivered to Buyer upon Escrow Holders receipt of Buyers Disapproval Notice prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period despite any objection or
potential objection by Seller.  ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS 
4.1 Sellers Representations. Except as otherwise disclosed in writing to Buyer and as acknowledged by Buyer and Seller in
Section 4.1.29 hereof, Seller warrants and represents to Buyer as follows:  4.1.1 Seller is a duly formed

enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. 
4.1.2 Seller has or will cause to be conveyed to Buyer good and marketable title to the Property. There are no outstanding

approval of the tenant as may be required by the Leases.  4.1.6 There are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending, or, to the best of Sellers knowledge, threatened (a) affecting Seller, which if determined adversely, would affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder; or (b) against any portion of the Property. To the best of
Sellers knowledge, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against Property Owner, which if determined adversely, would affect its ability to perform under the JDL Agreement. 
4.1.7 Seller has not (a) made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (b) filed any voluntary

neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement nor compliance herewith (a) conflicts or will conflict with or results or will result in a breach of or constitutes or will constitute a default under (i) the articles of
incorporation and by-laws or other organization certificate and/or partnership or operating agreement of Seller, or (ii) any law or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority, or (b) results in the
creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon its property pursuant to any such agreement or instrument. To the best of Sellers knowledge, neither the execution, delivery or performance of the JDL Agreement nor compliance
therewith (a) conflicts or will conflict with or results or will result in a breach of or constitutes or will constitute a default under (i) the articles of incorporation and by-laws or other organization certificate and/or partnership or
operating agreement of Seller or Property Owner, or (ii) any law or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority, or (b) results in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon its

4.1.11 Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer complete copies of all Leases and other occupancy agreements
affecting the Property. The Rent Rolls are true, correct and complete in all material respects. All the Leases are in full force and effect. Seller covenants that Buyer will be a permitted assignee (subject to the tenants consent as required
by the Leases), under each of the Leases at Closing. Neither Seller, Property Owner nor any tenant shall be in default under the Leases and at Closing and there will exist no condition or circumstance or
  
8 



written notice of any condition or circumstance which, with the passage of time, would constitute a default of either Seller, Property Owner or any tenant. No tenant is asserting any claim of
offset or other defense in respect of the landlords obligations under the Leases, and there are no unresolved disputes relating to the calculation of additional rent under the Leases. There are no pending or incomplete tenant improvements and
unpaid tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions with respect to the Leases and no pecuniary obligation to tenants and brokers has vested or accrued and is owed by Seller or to the best of Sellers knowledge, Property Owner, except that

including payments for taxes, utilities, common area maintenance, operating expenses, or insurance, or additional charges of any other nature (collectively CAM), based on a rental statement prepared by Seller and approved by Buyer (which
statement must be consistent with the final Rent Rolls).   (b) CAM; Impounds; Reconciliation. The
provisions of this subparagraph (b) shall apply in furtherance of the proration of tenant rents with respect to CAM under subparagraph (a) above: 
(i) Where any Lease provides for the payment of any CAM in arrears after being billed therefor by the landlord, Seller
shall be responsible for billing all unpaid CAM charges under such Lease for all collection periods ending prior to the Closing, and shall be further responsible for providing to Buyer, no later than thirty (30) days after the Closing, a final
determination of any CAM owed by such tenant for the period prior to the date of Closing, together with all relevant back-up, paid invoices, receipts, and other materials. The collection and remitting of any CAM unpaid as of the Closing shall be
governed by the provisions of subparagraph (c) below regarding the post-closing collection of Unpaid Rents. 
(ii) Where the landlord has collected any portion of CAM on an estimated basis, pursuant to so-called
impounds, or otherwise in advance, then the remaining provisions of this subparagraph (b) shall apply. If the landlords collection of such amounts is in excess of the amounts actually paid by the landlord for the items
comprising CAM for the period prior to Closing, then Buyer shall receive a credit at Closing for the excess amounts collected. Buyer shall apply all such excess amounts to the charges owed by Buyer for such items for the period after the Closing
and, if required by the Leases, shall rebate or credit the tenants with any remainder. If it is determined that the amount collected during prior to the Closing was less than the amounts actually paid by the landlord for such items for the period
prior to the Closing, then the collection and remitting of such amounts shall be governed by the provisions of subparagraph (c) below regarding the post-closing collection of Unpaid Rents. 
(iii) Prior to Closing, Seller shall prepare for Buyer's reasonable approval an estimated proration statement reconciling
the amounts paid by tenants in respect of CAM and the amounts actually paid by the landlord therefor. Such statement shall set forth the 
 
20 



parties estimate of the Buyers closing credit (if any), or of the amount to which Seller might be entitled with respect to the period prior to Closing (if any). If any of the
aforesaid prorations cannot be definitely calculated accurately as of the Closing, then they shall be recalculated as soon as practicable after the Closing. No later than thirty (30) days after the end of the lease year for the Leases, Seller
shall conduct a final reconciliation of any such overpayment or underpayment under the Leases to the date of Closing and shall provide such final reconciliation to Buyer, together with all relevant back-up, paid invoices, receipts, and other
materials; and if such final reconciliation indicates that Buyer was entitled to a larger credit with respect to the same than Buyer received at Closing, Seller shall immediately remit the shortfall to Buyer. 
(iv) Seller shall be responsible for conducting and completing all reconciliations of CAM charges versus any collections
or impound therefor, and for billing all unpaid CAM charges, to tenants for all lease years prior to the Closing pursuant to the terms of the Leases. The collection and remitting of any CAM unpaid as of the Closing shall be governed by the
provisions of subparagraph (c) below regarding the post-closing collection of Unpaid Rents.  (c) Unpaid
Rents. As used herein, the term Unpaid Rents means any tenant rentals and other sums (however denominated and including without limitation unpaid CAM) owed to the landlord under the Leases from any tenant and not paid as of the
Closing Date. Seller shall be entitled to all Unpaid Rents for the period prior to Closing and Buyer shall be entitled to all Unpaid Rents from the date of Closing and thereafter. Any sums received by Buyer to which Seller is entitled shall be held
in trust for Seller on account of such Unpaid Rents payable to Seller, and Buyer shall remit to Seller any such sums received by Buyer to which Seller is entitled within ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof. Seller expressly agrees that
if Seller receives any Unpaid Rents after the Closing Date which are attributable, in whole or in part, to any period after the Closing Date, Seller shall remit to Buyer that portion of the Unpaid Rents so received by Seller to which Buyer is
entitled within ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller specifically agrees not to undertake any effort to collect unpaid rent or other sums (however denominated) owed to Seller from any person if
such person or any affiliate of such person is in possession of any space in the Property at the time of any such collection effort. 
5.8.3 Security Deposits, Unpaid Rent Concessions, Unpaid Tenant Improvement Allowances and Other Tenant Credits.
The amount of all unapplied tenant security deposits, any accrued interest due tenants thereon, unpaid rent concessions due under any Lease, unpaid tenant improvement allowances owing under any Lease and the amount of any other credits due tenants
shall be credited to Buyer based on a rental statement prepared by Seller and approved by Buyer (which statement must be consistent with the Leases, the estoppel certificates and the final Rent Rolls). 
(a) Property Contracts. Prepaid charges in connection with any Property Contracts that Buyer elects to assume, or
licenses or permits, shall be credited to Seller. Accrued charges in connection with such Contracts, or licenses or permits, shall be credited to Buyer.   
21 


(b) Property Taxes. All real property taxes for the year immediately
preceding the year of Closing that are payable in the year of Closing, and for years prior thereto, shall be paid by Seller on or before the Closing. Real property taxes for the year of Closing shall be prorated on the basis of the most recent
assessment and levy. Any and all refunds, credits, claims or rights to appeal respecting the amount of any real property taxes or other taxes or assessments charged in connection with the Property for any period following Closing shall belong to
Buyer, except that if prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period Seller has applied for a property tax refund or has appealed the County, City or jurisdictional Assessors valuation of the Property for any period of time prior to the Closing
Date, then Seller shall be entitled to any refund applicable to such period (unless such refund must be credited to tenants of the Property by Buyer, in which case such refund shall belong to Buyer to the extent of such required credits to tenants)
and any refunds or credits for any year or partial year prior to Closing shall belong to Seller.  (c)
Private Assessments. Payments due under any assessments imposed by private covenant shall be prorated as of the Closing. 
(d) Utilities. Except to the extent such items are the responsibility of tenants, prepaid water, sewer, and other
utility charges shall be credited to Seller, and accrued water, sewer, and other utility charges shall be credited to Buyer. 
(e) Leasing Commissions. On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall pay in full all leasing commissions due to
leasing or other agents for the current remaining term of each lease (determined without regard to any unexercised termination or cancellation right). 
(f) Insurance Policies. Insurance premiums as to the policies, if any, that will continue after Closing.
 (g) Other Items. All other items customarily prorated or required by any other provision of this
Agreement to be prorated or adjusted.  5.8.4 Re-prorations. At Closing, the amount of prorations and
adjustments as aforesaid shall be determined or estimated to the extent practicable, and monetary adjustment shall be made between Seller and Buyer. As the amounts of the respective items become finally ascertained, further adjustment shall be
promptly made between the parties in cash.  5.8.5 Survival. The provisions of this Section 5.8
shall survive the Closing.  5.9 Distribution of Funds and Documents. At the Close of Escrow, Escrow Holder shall do
each of the following:  5.9.1 Payment of Encumbrances. Pay the amount of those monetary liens that are
not permitted as part of the Required Title Condition in accordance with the demands approved by Seller, utilizing funds to which Seller shall be entitled upon Close of Escrow and funds (if any) deposited in Escrow by Seller. 
 
22 


5.9.2 Recorded Documents. Submit (or be irrevocably committed to
submit) to the County or City Recorder of the County or City in which each Parcel of the Property is located the Deed for such Parcel and each other document to be recorded under the terms of this Agreement or by general usage, and, after
recordation, cause the County or City Recorder to mail each Deed to Buyer and each other such document to the grantee, beneficiary or person acquiring rights thereunder or for whose benefit said document was recorded. 
5.9.3 Non-Recorded Documents. Deliver by overnight courier (or as otherwise requested by the intended recipient):
(i) the Title Policy to Buyer; (ii) each other non-recorded document received hereunder to the payee or person acquiring rights thereunder or for whose benefit said document was acquired; and (iii) a copy of each recorded document,
conformed to show the recording data thereon, to each party.  5.9.4 Distribution of Funds. Deliver
(i) to Seller, or order, the cash portion of the Purchase Price, adjusted for prorations, charges and other credits and debits provided for herein; and (ii) to Buyer, or order, any excess funds delivered to Escrow Holder by Buyer. Such
funds shall be delivered by wire transfer or cashiers check in accordance with instructions for Seller and Buyer; if no instructions are given, Escrow Holder shall deliver such funds by Escrow Holders check via overnight courier (or as
otherwise requested by the intended recipient) to the appropriate party at the address set forth for notice in this Agreement. 
5.10 Completion of Documents. Escrow Holder is authorized to insert the date of Closing and otherwise to complete the documents
deposited in Escrow, where appropriate and consistent with this Agreement.  5.11 Possession and Tenant Notices.
Possession of the Property shall be delivered to Buyer by Seller at the Closing, subject only to the rights of tenants under the Leases, rights arising under any Property Contracts not terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 3.4 above, and
rights arising under the matters set forth in the Preliminary Report and permitted as part of the Required Title Condition. Seller and Buyer covenant and agree to execute at Closing a written notice of the acquisition of the Property by Buyer, in
sufficient copies for transmittal to all tenants affected by the sale and purchase of the Property and properly addressed to all such tenants. Such notice shall be prepared by Buyer, at Buyers cost and expense, and approved by Seller, shall
notify the tenants of the sale and transfer and shall contain appropriate instructions relating to the payment of future rentals, the giving of future notices and other matters reasonably required by Buyer or required by law. Unless a different
procedure is required by applicable law, in which event such laws shall be controlling, Buyer agrees to transmit or otherwise deliver such letters to the tenants promptly after the Closing. 
5.12 Durham Parcel Right of First Refusal. Upon expiration of the Due Diligence Period and the deposit by Buyer with Escrow Holder
of the Additional Deposit, Seller shall promptly cause Property Owner to provide to Campbell LLC all information required in order to comply with Sellers obligations in connection with the right of first refusal to purchase the Durham Parcel
as described in Section 4.1.2 above. Seller shall provide Buyer with all documents evidencing Property Owners compliance with such right of first refusal and Campbell LLCs failure or refusal to exercise such right. In the event that
Campbell LLC exercises its right of first refusal to acquire the Durham Parcel, then notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, this Agreement shall terminate with respect to the Durham Parcel and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the Durham Parcel as set forth in Schedule 1.3 hereto.   
23 


ARTICLE 6 
TERMINATION AND DEFAULT 
6.1 Buyer Default. If the sale contemplated hereby is not consummated because of a default by Buyer in its obligation to purchase
the Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement after Seller has performed or tendered performance of all of its material obligations in accordance with this Agreement, then: (a) this Agreement shall terminate; (b) the Deposit
shall be paid to and retained by Seller as liquidated damages; and (c) Seller and Buyer shall have no further obligations to each other except those which survive the termination of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the damages
to Seller in the event of a breach of this Agreement by Buyer would be difficult or impossible to determine, that the amount of the Deposit represents the parties best and most accurate estimate of the damages that would be suffered by Seller
if the transaction should fail to close and that such estimate is reasonable under the circumstances existing as of the date of this Agreement and under the circumstances that Seller and Buyer reasonably anticipate would exist at the time of such
breach. Buyer and Seller agree that Sellers right to retain the Deposit (not including any interest and earnings earned thereon) shall be Sellers sole remedy, at law and in equity, for Buyers failure to purchase the Property in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that this provision will not waive or affect Buyers indemnity obligations under this Agreement or Sellers rights to enforce those indemnity obligations, nor waive or affect
any of the Buyers other obligations under this Agreement to be performed after the Closing or Sellers right to enforce those obligations. Seller hereby waives any right to an action for specific performance of any provisions of this
Agreement.  6.2 Sellers Default. If prior to Closing Seller fails to perform any of its obligations or is
otherwise in default hereunder, Buyer shall have the right to exercise any or all of the following remedies: 
6.2.1 Waive such failure and proceed to the Closing with no reduction in the Purchase Price; provided, however, that this
provision will not waive or affect Sellers indemnity obligations under this Agreement or Buyers rights to enforce those indemnity obligations, nor waive or affect any of Sellers other obligations under this Agreement to be
performed after the Closing or Buyers rights to enforce those obligations.  6.2.2 Exercise any of its
other rights or remedies Buyer may have at law or in equity, including without limitation an action for specific performance to cause Seller to convey the Property to Buyer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
6.2.3 Terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller and Escrow Holder to that effect, to recover the full amount of the
Deposit and all earnings thereon.   
24 


ARTICLE 7 
CASUALTY DAMAGE OR CONDEMNATION 
7.1 Casualty. If the Improvements are damaged by casualty prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have the sole option to elect either
to:  (a) acquire the Property as is (without reduction in the Purchase Price), plus an assignment without
recourse or credit of any insurance proceeds payable by virtue of such loss or damage plus a credit for any deductible or uninsured loss under said policy; or 
(b) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit. 
Such right must be exercised within twenty (20) days from the date Seller provides Buyer with notice of the loss of
the event giving rise to such right. If Buyer fails to provide notice of an election, then Buyer shall have been deemed to elect (b) above. 
7.2 Condemnation. In the event that any portion of the Property should be condemned prior to the Closing, at Buyers sole
option, elect either to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit; or 
(b) close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 
In all other cases, or if Buyer elects to proceed under Section 7.2(b), Buyer shall purchase the Property in
accordance with the terms hereof (without reduction in the Purchase Price) and Seller shall assign to Buyer at Closing all condemnation proceeds payable as a result of such condemnation. Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to proceed under
Section 7.2(a) unless, within twenty (20) days from written notice of the condemnation, Buyer provides Seller with written notice that Buyer elects to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.2(b).  ARTICLE 8 
REAL ESTATE COMMISSION 
8.1 Commissions. Buyer and Seller each represent to the other that no brokers or real estate commissions or other fees,
other than the brokers commission payable by Seller to CBRE-DFW, are or shall be due in respect to this transaction by reason of any agreement made or which may be alleged to have been made by Buyer or Seller. Each party agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the other from and against any and all claims, demands or the cost or expense thereof, including reasonable attorneys fees, arising out of any brokers commission, fee or other compensation due or alleged to be due in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon an agreement alleged to have been made or other action alleged to have been taken by the indemnifying party. 
 
25

9.2 Binding On Successors and Assigns. Subject to Section 9.3, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  9.3 Assignment by Buyer. Buyer shall have the right
to assign this Agreement and no consent on the part of Seller shall be required for such assignment. In the event that Buyer assigns this Agreement, the assignee(s) of Buyer shall assume all obligations of Buyer hereunder; provided, that Buyer shall
remain primarily liable for the performance of Buyers obligations hereunder. In addition, Buyer shall have the right to designate the grantee(s) on each of the Deeds and other documents to be delivered by Seller at Closing. In the event that
the Property is acquired by a grantee other than Buyer as a result of Buyers designation in the Deeds and other documents as described in the preceding sentence, such grantee shall also succeed to all of Buyers rights under this
Agreement including, but not limited to, all rights of Buyer arising out of or resulting from Sellers representations and warranties made in Section 4.1, Sellers indemnification of Buyer under Section 4.5.1 and Buyers
right to recover Unpaid Rents collected by Seller under Section 5.8.2(b)(iv). Any such grantee shall be deemed to have assumed Buyers obligations to Seller under this Agreement including, but not limited to, all rights of Seller arising
out of or resulting from Buyers representations and warranties made in Section 4.2, Buyers indemnification of Seller under Section 4.5.2 and Sellers right to recover Unpaid Rents collected by Buyer under
Section 5.8.2(b)(iv).  9.4 Waiver. The excuse or waiver of the performance by a party of any obligation of the
other party under this Agreement shall only be effective if evidenced by a written statement signed by the party so excusing or waiving. No delay in exercising any right or remedy shall constitute a waiver thereof, and no waiver by Seller or Buyer
of the breach of any covenant of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other covenant or condition of this Agreement. 
9.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the internal laws of the State of Texas, without regard
to the principles of conflicts of law.  9.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts

9.8 Attorneys Fees. In the event of a judicial or administrative proceeding or action by one party against the other party
with respect to the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, whether at the

9.9 IRS Real Estate Sales Reporting. Buyer and Seller agree that Chicago Title Insurance Corporation shall act as the person
responsible for closing the transaction which is the subject of this Agreement pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 6045(e) and shall prepare and file all informational returns, including without limitation, IRS Form 1099-S, and
shall otherwise comply with the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 6045(e).  9.10 Time Periods. If the
time for performance of any obligation hereunder expires on a day that is not a Business Day, the time for performance shall be extended to the next Business Day. 
9.11 Modification of Agreement. No modification of this Agreement shall be deemed effective unless in writing and signed by the

other, shall execute and have acknowledged and delivered to the other or to the Escrow Holder, as may be appropriate, any and all further instruments reasonably requested or appropriate to evidence or give effect to the provisions of this Agreement
and which are consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.  9.13 Descriptive Headings; Word Meaning. The
descriptive headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any provisions of this Agreement. Words such as herein,
hereinafter, hereof and hereunder when used in reference to this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words appear, unless the context otherwise requires. The
singular shall include the plural and the masculine sender shall include the feminine and neuter, and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The word including shall not be restrictive and shall be interpreted as if followed
by the words without limitation.  9.14 Business Day. As used herein, the term Business Day
means any day other than Saturday, Sunday and any day which is a legal holiday in the State of Texas.   
28 


9.15 Construction of Agreement. This Agreement shall not be construed more strictly
against one party than against the other merely by virtue of the fact that it may have been prepared primarily by counsel for one of the parties, it being recognized that both Buyer and Seller have contributed substantially and materially to the
preparation of this Agreement.  9.16 Severability. The parties hereto intend and believe that each provision in this
Agreement comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions. However, if any provision in this Agreement is found by a court of law to be in violation of any applicable local, state or federal law, statute, ordinance,
administrative or judicial decision, or public policy, or if in any other respect such a court declares any such provision to be illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written, then it is the intent of all parties hereto that,
consistent with and with a view towards preserving the economic and legal arrangements among the parties hereto as expressed in this Agreement, such provision shall be given force and effect to the fullest possible extent, and that the remainder of
this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable provision were not contained herein, and that the rights, obligations and interests of the parties under the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect.  9.17 Exclusivity. After the Effective Date, Seller and its respective agents, representatives
and employees shall immediately cease all marketing of the Property until such time as this Agreement is terminated and Seller shall not directly or indirectly make, accept, negotiate, entertain or otherwise pursue any offers for the sale of the
Property.  9.18 Section 1031 Exchange. Either party may consummate the purchase or sale of the Property as part of
a so-called like kind exchange (an Exchange) pursuant to section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), provided that (i) the Closing shall not be delayed or affected by reason of an
Exchange nor shall the consummation or accomplishment of any Exchange be a condition precedent or condition subsequent to a partys obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any party desiring an Exchange shall effect its Exchange through an
assignment of this Agreement, or its rights under this Agreement, to a qualified intermediary and the other party shall not be required to take an assignment of the purchase agreement for the relinquished or replacement property or be required to
acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes of consummating such Exchange; and (iii) the party desiring an Exchange shall pay any additional costs that would not otherwise have been incurred by Buyer or Seller had such party not
consummated its purchase or sale through an Exchange. Neither party shall by this agreement or acquiescence to an Exchange desired by the other party (1) have its rights under this Agreement affected or diminished in any manner or (2) be
responsible for compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to the other party that such partys Exchange in fact complies with section 1031 of the Code. In connection with such cooperation, Seller agrees, upon request of Buyer to
direct deed for actual interests in the property to designees of Buyer.  9.19 Exculpation. No officer,
member, manager or other principal or employee of either Seller or Buyer shall have any personal liability under this Agreement.

AGREEMENT 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:  1. Deposit.
Section 1.4 of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 
Within one (1) Business Day after the Effective Date, Buyer shall deliver to Chicago Title Insurance Corporation,
5501 LBJ Freeway, Suite 200, Dallas, Texas 75240 Attn: David Long [Telephone: 214-987-6789; Facsimile: 214-987-6788; Email: david.long@cttdallas.com] (Escrow Holder), a good faith deposit in the amount of One Hundred Thousand and 00/100
Dollars ($100,000.00) (the Initial Deposit), and within three (3) Business Days following the end of the Due Diligence Period (defined below in Section 3.2), assuming Buyer has not previously terminated this Agreement, Buyer
shall deliver to Escrow Holder a second good faith deposit (Second Deposit) of Seventy One Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($71,000.00). Further, within one (1) Business Day following the end of the Lawrence Due Diligence Period
(defined below in Section 3.2), assuming Buyer has not previously terminated this Agreement as it relates to that parcel of the Property described in Exhibit A-2 attached hereto and incorporated by reference (the Lawrence Parcel),
Buyer shall deliver to Escrow Holder a third good faith deposit (Third Deposit) of Twenty Nine Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($29,000.00). The Initial Deposit, the Second Deposit and the Third Deposit shall be collectively referred to as

Closing, there is a failure of a condition precedent set forth in Section 5.4 below, there is a casualty or condemnation, or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, and shall constitute liquidated damages to Seller if escrow fails to
close solely as a result of Buyers default as provided in Section 6.1 below below. In the event Buyer shall elect to terminate this Agreement during the Due Diligence Period, the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer as provided in
Section 3.6 below.  2. Due Diligence Period. Section 3.2 of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety and replaced with the following:  3.2 Due Diligence Period. Buyer shall have the period

furnished by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3 below, and all records and other materials related thereto as Buyer deems appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have the period commencing on the Effective Date of this
Agreement and ending on July 2, 2010 (the Lawrence Due Diligence Period) to perform environmental examinations and review the Lawrence Parcel with respect to those examinations. 
3. Termination With Respect to the Lawrence Parcel. Section 3.5 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the
following at the end of the text:  Further, Buyer shall have the right to approve in Buyers sole and
absolute discretion the Lawrence Parcel. On or before the last day of the Lawrence Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall provide written notice (Lawrence Approval Notice) to Seller and Escrow Holder that Buyer has approved the Lawrence
Parcel. Buyers failure to provide an Initial Approval Notice upon the expiration of the Lawrence Due Diligence Period shall be deemed a disapproval of the Lawrence Parcel. At any time prior to the expiration of the Lawrence Due Diligence
Period, Buyer may provide written notice to Seller and Escrow Holder disapproving of the Lawrence Parcel (Lawrence Disapproval Notice). Upon giving of a Lawrence Disapproval Notice or the deemed disapproval of the Lawrence
  
2 



Parcel, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect; provided however that this Agreement shall terminate with respect to the Lawrence Parcel and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the Lawrence Parcel as set forth in Schedule 1.3 hereto.  4. Limited
Approval. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that notwithstanding its continued review of the environmental matters associated with the Lawrence Parcel during the duration of the Lawrence Due Diligence Period, Buyer has approved all other aspects of
the Property in accordance with the terms of the Original Agreement.  5. Entire Agreement. The Original Agreement, as
modified by this Third Amendment, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated therein. Except as modified by this Third Amendment, the Original Agreement remains unchanged and unmodified
and in full force and effect, and the parties hereto hereby ratify and affirm the same.  6. Counterparts. This Third
Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and it shall be sufficient that the signature of each party appear on one or more such counterparts. All counterparts shall collectively constitute a single agreement. Signatures to this Third
Amendment transmitted by facsimile or electronic mail shall be treated as originals in all respects.  [Remainder of page

receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:  1. Closing
Date. Section 1.5 of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 
1.5 Closing Date. 
1.5.1 The closing for all parcels other than the Lawrence Parcel (the Portfolio Closing) shall take place
through an escrow opened with Escrow Holder on such date as may be selected by Buyer upon not less than five (5) Business Days notice to Seller, but in no event later than July 14, 2010 (the Portfolio Closing Date).
 1.5.2 The closing for the Lawrence Parcel (the Lawrence Closing) shall take place through an
escrow opened with Escrow Holder on a date that is twenty (20) days after the expiration of the Lawrence Due Diligence Period (as defined below) or at such earlier date as Buyer may designate upon five (5) Business Days notice to
