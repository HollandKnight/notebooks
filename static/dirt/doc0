Exhibit 10.10  REAL ESTATE SALE AGREEMENT  [1600 Technology Drive, San
Jose, California]  THIS REAL ESTATE SALE AGREEMENT (this Agreement) is made effective as of
January 25, 2010 (the Effective Date), by and between Brocade Communications Systems Skyport LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Seller), and CA-Skyport III Limited Partnership, a Delaware
limited partnership (Purchaser). In consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Seller and
Purchaser agree as follows:  1. PURCHASE AND SALE OF PROPERTY. Subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser shall purchase from Seller and Seller shall sell to Purchaser a certain parcel of real estate (the Real Property) in the City of San Jose, County of Santa Clara, State of
California, which parcel is more particularly described in attached Exhibit A, and upon which is located an office building commonly known as 1600 Technology Drive, together with (a) all buildings and improvements
owned by Seller, and any and all of Sellers rights, easements, licenses and privileges presently thereon or appertaining thereto (the Improvements), (b) Sellers right, title and interest, to the
extent transferable, in and to (i) the right to use the name 1600 Technology Drive, (ii) all licenses and permits relating solely to the Property, (iii) any blueprints, plans, specifications, maps or drawings relating
solely to the Property (it being agreed that Seller shall be obligated to deliver possession of the foregoing only to the extent in Sellers possession or control), and (iv) any guaranties or warranties relating to the Improvements; and
(c) equipment located within Garage B (as defined in the Skyport Plaza (Adjusted Parcel II) Declaration of Common Easements, Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (the Declaration)) and listed on Schedule 1 to
Exhibit G attached hereto (the Exterior Equipment) (all of the foregoing, collectively referred to in this Agreement as the Property); provided, however, the term Property expressly
excludes all property listed on Exhibit B attached hereto.  2. CONSIDERATION. The total consideration to
be paid by Purchaser to Seller for the purchase of the Property is THIRTY MILLION THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND and No/100 Dollars ($30,350,000.00) (the Consideration).  2.1 Deposit. Within two (2) business days after the Effective Date, Purchaser shall deposit in escrow with First
American Title Insurance Company, with an address of 1737 North First Street, Suite 500, San Jose, California 95112, telephone: (408) 451-7800, contact Dian Blair (Escrow Holder), a deposit in the amount of Four Million
Dollars ($4,000,000.00) (the Deposit), which shall be fully non-refundable to the extent provided in this Section 2.1. If Purchaser fails to make the Deposit on or before the fifth (5th) business day following the
Effective Date, then this Agreement shall terminate, and shall be of no force or effect. All sums constituting the Deposit shall be held in a federally insured interest-bearing account. If the sale of the Property as contemplated hereunder is
consummated, the Deposit plus interest accrued thereon shall be credited against the Consideration. If the sale of the Property is not consummated because of the failure of any condition precedent or Sellers default hereunder, then the
  
1 



Deposit plus interest accrued thereon shall immediately be returned to Purchaser. If the sale is not consummated because of Purchasers default hereunder, the Deposit, together with interest
accrued thereon shall be paid to and retained by Seller as liquidated damages, in accordance with the provision below.  THE PARTIES HAVE
AGREED THAT SELLERS ACTUAL DAMAGES, IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THIS SALE BECAUSE OF A PURCHASER DEFAULT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE. AFTER NEGOTIATION, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT, CONSIDERING ALL
THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING ON THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT, PLUS ALL INTEREST ACCRUED THEREON, IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES THAT SELLER WOULD INCUR IN SUCH EVENT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THIS PROVISION WILL NOT
COVER OR APPLY TO, AND SHALL NOT LIQUIDATE OR LIMIT SELLERS RIGHT TO RECOVER OR PURCHASERS LIABILITY FOR ATTORNEYS FEES OR FOR BREACH BY PURCHASER OF ANY OF PURCHASERS INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. BY PLACING
ITS INITIALS BELOW, EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY CONFIRMS THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS MADE ABOVE AND THE FACT THAT EACH PARTY WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL WHO EXPLAINED, AT THE TIME THIS AGREEMENT WAS MADE, THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
PROVISION.   








INITIALS:
 
Seller             
 
Purchaser              2.2 Balance of Consideration. At Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the Consideration, plus or minus the
prorations described in this Agreement (such amount, as adjusted, being referred to as the Cash Balance). Purchaser shall pay the Cash Balance by federal funds wire transferred to First American Title Insurance Company,
located in San Jose, California (Escrow Agent) .  3. DUE DILIGENCE AND TITLE REVIEW  3.1 Delivery of Due Diligence Materials by Seller. To the extent within the possession or control of Seller, Seller
has previously delivered to Purchaser and Purchasers representatives any environmental studies, soils studies, plans, specifications, maps, surveys and other similar materials relating to the physical and environmental condition of the
Property (Reports). Purchaser acknowledges and understands that all such materials were made available by Seller only for Purchasers convenience in making its own examination and determination as to whether it wishes to
purchase the Property, and, in so doing, Purchaser shall rely exclusively upon its own independent investigation and evaluation of every aspect of the Property and not on any materials supplied by Seller. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Seller has also previously made available the following due diligence items (together with the Reports, collectively, Due Diligence Items): (a) to the extent in the possession of Seller or Sellers property
manager, any plans and specifications for the Property; (b) copies of all service contracts
  
2 



or service agreements relating to the operation and maintenance of the Property (collectively, the Contracts); (c) property tax bills for the last two (2) fiscal tax
years and the property tax bill for the current year to the extent in the possession of Seller; and (d) to the extent in the possession of Seller, operating statements for the Property for the last two (2) calendar years and the current
year-to-date.  3.2 Evidence of Title. Seller has heretofore caused to be delivered to Purchaser
(a) a current preliminary title report on the Real Property dated as of November 23, 2009, issued by First American Title Insurance Company, with an address of 1737 North First Street, San Jose, California 95112, telephone:
(408) 451-7800, contact Dian Blair (the Title Insurer) under Order Number: NCS-421391-SC (the Title Report), (b) available copies of all title exception documents referred to in the Title
Report, and (c) any existing survey of the Real Property and the Improvements in Sellers possession, if any (the Survey). In addition, Seller has ordered, and will provide to Purchaser when it is available, a current
ALTA/ACSM survey of the Real Property and the Improvements prepared by Kier and Wright (the Updated Survey). At Closing, as a condition precedent to Purchasers obligations hereunder, Title Insurer shall issue an ALTA
Owners Title Insurance Policy, with liability in the amount of the Purchase Price, showing title vested in Purchaser or its assignee, subject only to those exceptions which are listed on Exhibit D (the Permitted
Exceptions).  4. CLOSING. The payment of the Consideration, the transfer of title to the Property and
the satisfaction of all other terms and conditions of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (the Closing) shall occur on January 28, 2010, or such earlier date as the parties may mutually agree (such day being
sometimes referred to as the Closing Date), through escrow at the San Jose office of the Title Insurer.  4.1 Sellers Closing Deliveries. At Closing, Seller shall execute (as necessary), or cause to be executed, and deliver to Purchaser (either through escrow or as otherwise provided below) each
of the documents described below: (a) one original Grant Deed, in the form of Exhibit E, subject to the exceptions listed in such form and the Permitted Exceptions; (b) Sellers non-foreign affidavit, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit H, and a properly executed California Form 593-C certifying that Seller is qualified to do business in California; (c) two original counterparts of the Closing Statement (as defined in

(f) a Bill of Sale (the Bill of Sale) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G; and (g) an Assignment of Intangibles (the Assignment of Intangibles) from Seller to Purchaser in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F. The Closing Statement may be signed in facsimile counterparts on the Closing Date. To the extent available, Seller shall leave all of the original plans and specifications, licenses and permits pertaining
to the Property at the premises.  4.2 Purchasers Closing Deliveries. At Closing, Purchaser shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller executed counterparts of the Closing Statement, the Leaseback, the Assignment of Intangibles and the Transfer Documents, together with the Cash Balance described in Section 2.1 above, and such
evidence of Purchasers power and authority as Seller or Title Insurer may reasonably request.

4.3 Closing Prorations and Adjustments. The provisions of this
Section 4.3 shall survive the Closing. The Title Company shall prepare a statement of the prorations and adjustments required by this Agreement (the Closing Statement), and submit it to Purchaser and Seller for
approval at least one (1) business day prior to the Closing Date. The items listed below are to be equitably prorated or adjusted as of the close of business on the Closing Date, except as provided otherwise below, it being understood that for
purposes of prorations and adjustments, Seller shall be deemed the owner of the Property on such day and Purchaser shall be deemed the owner of the Property as of the day after the Closing Date.  4.3.1 Taxes and Fees. Real property taxes, special taxes, and any installment payments on account of assessments or
bonds applicable to the Property or any part thereof, and annual permits and/or inspection fees (calculated on the basis of the period covered) shall be prorated as of the Closing Date on the basis of a 365-day year. The remaining principal amount
(after the application of the prorated portion of any installment applicable to the period prior to the Closing Date) of any and all assessments and/or bonds which encumber the Property or any part thereof shall not be prorated or apportioned, but
shall be assumed in full by Purchaser as of Closing (and Purchaser shall not be entitled to a credit from Seller against the Purchase Price in the amount of such assessments and/or bonds).  4.3.2 Utility Deposits. Seller shall be entitled to recover any and all deposits with respect to the Property held by
any utility company as of the Closing Date.  4.3.3 Utilities. Water, electric, telephone and all other
utility and fuel charges, fuel on hand (at cost plus sales tax), and any other payments to utility companies shall be prorated to the extent not paid by Seller (or its affiliate) directly to third parties or to Purchaser as additional rent under the
Leaseback.  4.3.4 Leaseback. To the extent that, pursuant to the Leaseback, Seller (or its affiliate) is
paying the charges for any expenses subject to proration pursuant to this Section 4.3 directly to the applicable governmental entity, utility or service provider, or other third party, prorations of such expenses shall be made with respect to
such expenses upon termination of the Leaseback, rather than on the Closing Date. To the extent that, pursuant to the Leaseback, Seller (or its affiliate) is paying the charges for any expenses subject to proration pursuant to this Section 4.3
in the form of operating expense reimbursements to Purchaser under the Leaseback, prorations of such expenses shall be performed at the Closing and reconciliations of operating expenses shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Leaseback.

4.4 Reservation of Rights to Contest. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Seller reserves the exclusive right to meet with governmental officials and to contest any reassessment or assessment of the Property or any portion thereof and to attempt to obtain a refund for any taxes
previously paid. Seller shall retain all rights with respect to any refund of taxes applicable to any period prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller, at Sellers reasonable request and at Sellers expense, if
necessary in connection with any such contest or reassessment, which cooperation may include executing applications or other documents.  4.5 Transaction Costs. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, the closing costs and other costs incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid as follows: (a) Seller shall pay (i) the base premium payable to the Title Company in connection with the issuance of an CLTA standard owners title policy, (ii) all recording fees for title clearance documents,
(iii) county transfer taxes, (iv) one-half of city transfer taxes, (v) all legal fees payable to attorneys retained by Seller, and (vi) one-half of all escrow fees payable to the Escrow Agent; and (b) Purchaser shall pay for
(i) title insurance costs and fees for the ALTA extended owners coverage (except those expressly the responsibility of Seller as provided above), including fees for extended coverage, endorsements, coinsurance or reinsurance, and any loan
policy charges, (ii) one-half of the city transfer taxes, (iii) recording charges (except those expressly the responsibility of Seller as provided above), (iv) costs incurred in connection with obtaining any survey of the Property
that Purchaser elects to obtain, and (v) one-half of all escrow fees payable to Escrow Agent. At Closing, Purchaser also shall reimburse Seller for the cost of the Updated Survey in the amount of $4,800. All other closing and other transaction
costs shall be allocated according to customary practice in San Jose, California. Seller and Purchaser shall, however, be responsible for the fees of their respective attorneys. The provisions of this Section 4.5 shall survive any termination
of this Agreement.  4.6 Reprorations. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, all
reprorations contemplated by this Agreement shall be completed within one (1) year of Closing (subject to extension solely as necessary due to the unavailability of final information, but in no event to exceed two (2) years after Closing).
The provisions of this Section 4.7 shall survive the Closing.  5. LEASEBACK. As of the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall lease the entire Building to Sellers parent corporation, Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., pursuant to a written lease in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the Leaseback). 
6. BROKERAGE. Seller agrees to pay any brokerage commission due to Studley for services rendered in connection with the sale and
purchase of the Property pursuant to separate agreement between Seller and Studley. Seller and Purchaser shall each indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims of all other brokers and finders claiming by, through or
under the indemnifying party and in any way related to the sale and purchase of the Property, this Agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses incurred by the indemnified party in connection with such
claim.

7. DEFAULT AND REMEDIES.  7.1 Purchasers Remedies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if Closing does
not occur due to a Seller default, then, as Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy hereunder and at Purchasers option, either (a) Purchaser may terminate this Agreement and recover the Deposit and interest accrued thereon; or
(b) upon notice to Seller not more than ten (10) days after Purchaser becomes aware of such failure, and provided an action is filed within thirty (30) days thereafter, Purchaser may seek specific performance of this Agreement but not
damages. Purchasers failure to seek specific performance as aforesaid shall constitute its election to proceed under clause (a) above.  7.2 Sellers Remedies. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that it would be extremely impractical and difficult to ascertain the actual damages which would be suffered by Seller if Purchaser
fails to consummate the purchase and sale contemplated herein for any reason other than Sellers default hereunder in any material respect or the failure of a condition precedent to Purchasers obligation to close hereunder. Purchaser and
Seller have considered carefully the expenses of Seller incurred in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and Sellers performance hereunder, and the other damages, general and special, which Purchaser and Seller realize and
recognize Seller will sustain but which Seller cannot at this time calculate with absolute certainty. Based on all those considerations, Purchaser and Seller have agreed that the damage to Seller in such event would reasonably be expected to be
equal to the sum of the Deposit. Accordingly, if Purchaser fails to consummate the purchase of the Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement solely as a result of a default by Purchaser, then (i) Seller shall have the right to
retain the entire Deposit as full and complete liquidated damages, and (ii) the ROFO Agreement shall terminate and thereafter be of no force or effect.  THE PARTIES FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (A) PURCHASER SEEKS TO LIMIT ITS LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT IN THE EVENT THIS AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED AND THE
TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT CLOSE DUE TO A DEFAULT OF PURCHASER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AND (B) THE PAYMENT OF SUCH LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS NOT INTENDED AS A FORFEITURE OR PENALTY WITHIN THE MEANING OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE
SECTIONS 3275 OR 3369, BUT IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO SELLER PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTIONS 1671, 1676 AND 1677.   






Seller:             
 
Purchaser:              7.3 Post-Closing Remedies. After Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, have such rights and remedies as are available at law or in equity, except that neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be entitled to recover from the other consequential or special damages.

10 



as a result of any such damage or destruction or condemnation plus the amount of any applicable insurance deductibles less any monies actually expended by Seller to repair any damage, or such
proceeds shall be assigned to Purchaser if not then collected. If such damage or destruction, or the diminution in value resulting from such condemnation, does not satisfy clauses (a) and (b) of the preceding sentence, Purchaser may at its
option either terminate this Agreement or consummate this purchase. If Purchaser proceeds with the purchase, all insurance proceeds and condemnation awards shall be paid over to Purchaser (or assigned if not yet collected) and all applicable
deductible amounts shall be credited against the Purchase Price, less only such monies actually expended by Seller to repair any damage.  12. MISCELLANEOUS.  12.1 Entire Agreement. All
understandings and agreements heretofore had between Seller and Purchaser with respect to the Property are merged in this Agreement, which, together with the exhibits hereto, fully and completely expresses the agreement of the parties. Purchaser

Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon Seller and Purchaser and their respective successors and assigns.  12.3 Modifications. This Agreement shall not be modified or amended except in a written document signed by Seller and
Purchaser.  12.4 Time of Essence. Time is of the essence of this Agreement. In the computation of any
period of time provided for in this Agreement or by law, the day of the act or event from which the period of time runs shall be excluded, and the last day of such period shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which
case the period shall be deemed to run until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
