limitation, sculptures, paintings, artwork, and the personal property listed on Exhibit B attached hereto (collectively, the Personal Property). 
1.1.4 All of Sellers rights in the lease between Seller and the United States of America (the Tenant),
dated February 12, 2007, (as amended, the Lease), and any leases that may be subsequently entered into in accordance with this Agreement, and including Sellers rights to any tenant deposit held by Seller (the Tenant

1 


1.1.6 All of Sellers rights, if any, in all service contracts (other
than management and leasing contracts) affecting the Land or Improvements as set forth on Exhibit D attached hereto (the Property Contracts), to the extent Buyer assumes the same in accordance with
Section 4.4.2 below.  1.1.7 All rights, which the Seller may have, if any, in and to any Tenant data,

hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the Real Property and the Real Property, Personal Property, Leases, Tenant Deposits, Intangible Property, the Property Contracts and the Miscellaneous Property, are hereinafter sometimes
referred to collectively as the Property.  1.2 Purchase and Sale. Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller and
Seller agrees to sell to Buyer all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Property, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
1.3 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Property (the Purchase Price) shall be Thirteen Million Eight Hundred
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($13,800,000.00). The Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller by Buyer on the Closing Date (defined in Section 1.5), plus or minus all adjustments or credits as set forth herein, by wire transfer of immediately
available federal funds.  1.4 Deposit. Within three (3) business days after the Effective Date, Buyer shall
deliver to Chicago Title Insurance Corporation, 830 East Main Street, Suite 1600, Richmond, VA 23219, Attn: Chris Newman (Escrow Holder), a good faith deposit in the amount of Seventy Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($75,000.00) (the
Initial Deposit), and within three (3) business days following the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (defined in Section 3.2), assuming Buyer has not previously terminated this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to Escrow
Holder an additional good faith deposit (Additional Deposit) of One Hundred Twenty Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($125,000.00). The Initial Deposit and the Additional Deposit shall be collectively referred to herein as the
Deposit. The Deposit shall be held in an insured, interest-bearing account with interest accruing for the benefit of Buyer. The Deposit (and any interest earned thereon) shall be applied to the Purchase Price if the Closing occurs.
Unless Buyer shall have timely delivered its Disapproval Notice as provided in Section 3.4 hereof, upon the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (as defined in Section 3.2 hereof) the Deposit shall automatically become nonrefundable to
Buyer unless escrow fails to close solely due to one or more of the following (i) Sellers default as described in Section 6.2 of this Agreement, (ii) a failure of a material representation or warranty by Seller to be
substantially true and correct as of the Closing, (iii) a failure of a condition precedent set forth in Section 5.4, (iv) a casualty or condemnation affecting a material portion of the Real Property, or (v) as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement [(i) through (v) being collectively referred to as a Non-Buyer Failure)], and the Deposit shall constitute liquidated damages to Seller if escrow fails to close as a result of Buyers default as
provided in Section 6.1 below. In the event Buyer shall elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Deposit (and any interest earned thereon) shall be returned to Buyer as provided in Section 3.5 below.

1. 
1.5 Closing Date. 
1.5.1 The Closing shall take place on or before 2:00 p.m. EST on September 30, 2010 (the Closing Date)
through an escrow opened with Escrow Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer has the right, upon not less than five (5) business days prior written notice to Seller, to accelerate the Closing Date. In addition to the foregoing, Buyer
and Seller may elect to hold the Closing at such other place and on such other later date as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree in writing. For purposes of this Agreement Close of Escrow or Closing means the date and time
Escrow Holder disburses funds in accordance with this Agreement and is irrevocably committed to record the Deed (defined in Section 5.6.1). 
1.5.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing Section 1.5.1, Buyer shall have the right to
unilaterally extend the Closing Date for up to four (4) additional seven (7) consecutive calendar day periods beyond the Closing Date provided in Section 1.5.1 above. In order to exercise this right to extend the Closing Date for any
such seven (7) consecutive calendar day period, not later than two (2) business days prior to the applicable Closing Date (as the same may be extended in accordance herewith) Buyer shall provide written notice to the Seller of its election
to extend the Closing Date for an additional seven (7) consecutive calendar days (Closing Extension Notice) and simultaneously deliver to Escrow Holder the sum of Twenty Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($25,000.00) (the
Closing Extension Deposit). Any Closing Extension Deposits shall be deemed part of the Deposit and shall be applied to the Purchase Price if the Closing occurs. If Closing does not occur all Extension Deposits shall be retained by Seller
unless the failure to close on the purchase of the Property results from a Non-Buyer Failure.  2. 
ARTICLE 2 - TITLE AND SURVEY 
2.1 Title and Survey. During the Due Diligence Period (defined in Section 3.2), Buyer, at Buyers cost and expense, may
obtain a preliminary title report or commitment (the Preliminary Report, which Preliminary Report will be based upon the prior title insurance policy issued to Seller by Escrow Holders affiliate, Lawyers Title Insurance
Corporation) from Escrow Holder (referred to in such capacity herein as, the Title Company), together with legible copies of all recorded encumbrances and exceptions to title as well as an existing survey, if any, from Seller. Buyer
shall, at its option and at its expense, (i) conduct UCC searches covering Seller and the Property (the UCC Searches) and (ii) order an update of the existing survey of the Real Property by a licensed surveyor or registered
professional engineer (the Survey).  2.2 Review of the Preliminary Report, Survey and UCC Searches; Objection;
Approval or Termination. On or before the last day of the Due Diligence Period (defined in Section 3.2), Buyer may deliver to Seller a written notice (the Title Objection Notice) setting forth any matters shown on the
Preliminary Report, Survey or UCC Searches to which Buyer   
3 



objects and requires be eliminated, (the Title Objections). Buyer may make its determination of whether any of the matters contained in the Preliminary Report, Survey or UCC Searches
(as applicable) are appropriate or are objectionable in its sole but reasonable discretion. Buyers failure to give the Title Objection Notice in a timely manner shall be deemed to constitute Buyers approval of matters disclosed in the
Preliminary Report, Survey, or UCC Searches (as applicable) and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If Buyer delivers a Title Objection Notice in a timely manner, Seller shall have five (5) business days from the receipt of
the Title Objection Notice (the Sellers Response Period) to provide Buyer with written notice of Sellers election to remove or otherwise cure to Buyers reasonable satisfaction all or a portion of the Title Objections
prior to the Closing (Seller Response Notice); provided however, and notwithstanding Buyers inclusion or lack thereof in any Title Objection Notice, Seller shall be obligated to eliminate all monetary liens or similar encumbrances,
and any exceptions created or consented to by Seller after the Effective Date (collectively, the Required Cure Items), unless approved in writing by Buyer, which Seller shall cause to be released at Closing. With the exception of the
Required Cure Items, if Seller fails to deliver the Seller Response Notice within the Seller Response Period (or if the Seller Response Notice indicates certain Title Objections which Seller elects to not remove or cure), then Seller shall be deemed
to have elected to not cure any of the Title Objections. If Seller timely delivers notice of election not to cure a disapproved item, or is deemed to have done so as provided above, then Buyer may either (i) elect to terminate this Agreement,
or (ii) waive in writing its prior disapproval of such item and accept title subject to such previously disapproved item, in either case by delivering notice of Buyers election to Seller within five (5) business days after the
receipt of the Seller Response Notice (the Buyer Response Period). If Buyer fails to deliver its notice as provided in the preceding sentence within the Buyer Response Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved of Sellers Response
Notice and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 2.2, the provisions of Section 3.5 shall apply. Any matter which is shown on the Preliminary Report, Survey or
UCC Searches and which is not included in Buyers Title Objection Notice, together with any matter which is included in such Title Objection Notice but is thereafter waived or deemed waived by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 2.2, are collectively called the Accepted Title Matters.  2.3 Required Title Condition. Title
to the Property shall be conveyed to Buyer subject only to the following permitted encumbrances (the Required Title Condition): (a) current, non-delinquent real estate taxes and assessments, (B) the Accepted Title Matters,
(c) the Lease, (d) any other matters approved in writing, or caused, by Buyer.  ARTICLE 3 - INSPECTION AND DUE
DILIGENCE PERIOD  3.1 Access. From and after the Effective Date through the Closing, Buyer, personally or through
its authorized agent or representatives, shall be entitled, upon reasonable advance notice to Seller (and at all times strictly in accordance with the terms of the Lease), to enter upon the Property during normal business hours and shall have the
right to make such investigations, including Tenant interviews, appraisals, engineering studies, soil tests, environmental studies and underwriting analyses, as Buyer deems reasonably necessary or advisable. Buyer shall have the right to conduct a
Phase I environmental site assessment, and, if necessary and agreed to in writing by Seller, a Phase II environmental site assessment (including soils borings, soil 
 
4 



sampling and, if relevant, ground water testing, with respect to the Property). Buyers activities at the Property shall be conducted diligently, at all times in accordance with the Lease
and in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the occupancy of the Tenant or its employees, licensees or invitees. Regarding Buyers investigations, in addition to the forgoing: 
a. Prior to its conduct of any inspection activities, Buyer must deliver evidence satisfactory to Seller that Buyer has
insurance for its proposed inspection activities, in amounts and with coverages that are substantially the same as those maintained by Seller or in such lesser amounts or with such lesser coverages as are reasonably satisfactory to Seller, and that
Seller and the Tenant have been named as additional insureds with respect to said insurance coverages;  b.
Buyer must notify Seller not less than three (3) business days in advance of Buyers plans to conduct tests so that Seller may be present during the tests; 
c. if the Land or Improvements are altered or otherwise affected physically because of Buyers inspections, Buyer
must return the Land or Improvements to their pre-inspection condition immediately after the alteration occurs; 
d. Buyer must deliver to Seller copies of all inspection reports that Buyer prepares or receives from third-party
consultants or contractors within three (3) days after their preparation or receipt by Buyer;  e. Buyer
must abide by any other reasonable entry rules imposed by Seller or the Tenant;  f. Seller shall, at
Sellers cost and expense, turn on, run and maintain, without any interruption in service, electrical power and all utilities to the Property (to the extent the Seller is permitted access to the same) to facilitate Buyers testing and
investigations;  g. Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold Seller harmless from any loss, reasonable
attorneys fees, expenses and claims of whatsoever nature arising out of or relating to Buyers investigation of the Land or Improvements, except remediation of existing conditions discovered by Buyers inspections. The obligations of
Buyer under this provision will survive termination of this Agreement and Closing; and  h. Buyer releases
Seller and those persons acting on Sellers behalf from all claims and causes of action (including claims for attorneys fees and court and other costs) resulting from Buyers investigation of the Land or Improvements. 
 


3.
 3.2 Due Diligence
Period. Buyer shall have from the Effective Date until 5:00 p.m. EST on September 17, 2010 (the Due Diligence Period) to physically inspect the Property, review the economic data, underwrite the Tenant and review the Lease,
conduct appraisals, perform examinations of the physical condition of the Improvements, examine the Property for the presence of Hazardous Materials (defined in Section 4.2.2), and to otherwise conduct such due diligence review of the Property
and all of the items to be furnished by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3 below, and all records and other materials related thereto as Buyer deems appropriate.   

5 


3.3 Items to be Provided by Seller. To the extent within Sellers possession,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer (by electronic or overnight delivery) accurate and complete copies of all of the information set forth on Exhibit G attached hereto and incorporated herein (Property Information). In
addition to the foregoing deliveries, Seller shall make available to Buyer for inspection and copying at Sellers offices located at One Oxford Centre, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219 the originals of any of the Property Information and any and
all other documents, instruments, studies, reports, surveys, maps, files, correspondence (including without limitation, Tenant correspondence files), reports and other materials related to the Property and not included in the Property Information.
Seller agrees to make available to Buyer new Property Information as it becomes available. Where financial statements are required, Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to have its auditor, BDO Seidman,
LLP, or another qualified auditor of Buyers choosing conduct an audit of the property financial statements and other information. 
3.4 Buyers Possible Early Termination. Buyer shall have the right to approve in Buyers sole and absolute discretion,
the Property, the Property Information, the Preliminary Report, the Survey, the UCC Searches, or any other matter whatsoever regarding the Property. At any time prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer may provide written notice to
Seller and Escrow Holder disapproving the Property (Disapproval Notice). Upon the giving of a Disapproval Notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate subject to the provisions of Section 3.5. Buyers failure to provide
a Disapproval Notice prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period shall be deemed Buyers approval of the Property.  4.
 3.5 Consequences of Buyers Early Termination. Upon the giving of a Disapproval Notice, this Agreement shall
immediately terminate, and the parties shall be released from all further obligations under this Agreement (except with respect to the provisions set forth in Sections 3.1 (a), (c), (d), (e), (g) and (h), as well as any other provisions that by
their terms survive a termination of this Agreement); provided, however, that if Seller is in default hereunder at the time of such termination, Section 6.2 shall additionally apply. Provided Buyer is not then in default under the terms of this
Agreement, Escrow Holder shall pay the entire Deposit (and any interest earned thereon) to Buyer not later than one (1) business day following receipt of Buyers Disapproval Notice (or as soon as practicable after the then-current
investment of the Deposit is liquidated).  ARTICLE 4 - REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

6 



contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all documents contemplated hereby by Seller have been (or shall be on or prior to Closing) duly and validly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller and all required consents and approvals have been duly obtained and will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any indenture, agreement or
instrument to which Seller is a party.  4.1.2 Seller has good and marketable title to the Property. There are
no outstanding rights of first refusal, rights of reverter or options to purchase relating to the Property or any interest therein. To Sellers knowledge, other than the Lease there are no unrecorded or undisclosed documents or other matters
which affect title to the Property. Subject to the Lease, since it commenced ownership of the Property Seller has enjoyed the continuous and uninterrupted quiet possession, use and operation of the Property, without material complaint or objection
by any person.  4.1.3 Seller is not a foreign person within the meaning of Section 1445(f) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).  4.1.4 Neither Seller nor any of its
partners, members, shareholders or other equity owners is a person or entity with whom United States persons or entities are restricted from doing business under regulations of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) of the Department
of the Treasury (including those named on OFACs Specially Designated and Blocked Persons List) or under any statute, executive order (including, without limitation, the September 24, 2001, Executive Order Blocking Property and Prohibiting
Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism), or other governmental action, and is not and will not engage in any dealings or transactions or be otherwise associated with such persons or entities. 
4.1.5 No authorization, consent, and approval of a governmental authority is required for Sellers performance of its
obligations hereunder with respect to the Closing herein described to occur except for the consent of the government tenant occupying the Property pursuant to the Lease. 
4.1.6 There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the best of Sellers knowledge, threatened
(a) affecting Seller, which if determined adversely, would affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder; or (b) against any portion of the Property. 
4.1.7 Seller has not (a) made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (b) filed any voluntary
petition in bankruptcy or suffered the filing of an involuntary petition by Sellers creditors, (c) suffered the appointment of a receiver to take possession of all or substantially all of Sellers assets, (d) suffered the

creditors generally.  4.1.8 To the best of Sellers knowledge, neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement nor compliance herewith (a) conflicts or will conflict with or results or will result in a breach of or constitutes or will constitute a default under (i) the articles
  
7 



of incorporation and by-laws or other organization certificate and/or partnership or operating agreement of Seller, or (ii) any law or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental authority, or (b) results in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon its property pursuant to any such agreement or instrument.

affecting the Property except as provided in the Property Information.  4.1.10 There is no pending, threatened
or contemplated condemnation proceeding relating to the Property to the best of Sellers knowledge, and Seller has received no written notice from any governmental agency or official to the effect that any such proceeding is contemplated.

expense.  4.1.12 The financial statements of Property operations provided by Seller, including, but not limited
to, statements of revenue and expenses, balance sheets and statements of cash flow are true, correct and complete in all material respects. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the information contained therein for the

delay the Closing.  4.1.13 Intentionally omitted.4.1.14 Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer true
and complete copies of all contracts to which Seller is a party and affect the Property. Seller has not, within the last year, received any written notice of any default under any Property Contract or other such contract or agreement that has not

5.11 Possession and Tenant Notices. Possession of the Property shall be delivered to Buyer by Seller at the Closing, subject only
to the rights of the Tenant under the Lease, rights arising under any Property Contracts not terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 4.4.2 above, and rights arising under the matters included in the Required Title Condition. Seller and Buyer
covenant and agree to execute at Closing a written notice of the acquisition of the Property by Buyer, for transmittal to the Tenant. Such notice shall be prepared by Buyer, at Buyers cost and expense, and approved by Seller, shall notify the
Tenant of the sale and transfer and shall contain appropriate instructions relating to the payment of future rentals, the giving of future notices and other matters reasonably required by Buyer or required by law. Unless a different procedure is
required by applicable law, in which event such laws shall be controlling, Buyer agrees to transmit or otherwise deliver such letters to the Tenant promptly after the Closing. 
ARTICLE 6 - TERMINATION AND DEFAULT 
6.1 Buyer Default. If the sale contemplated hereby is not consummated because of a default by Buyer in its obligation to purchase
the Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement after Seller has performed or tendered performance of all of its material obligations in accordance with this Agreement, then: (a) this Agreement shall terminate; (b) the Deposit
shall be paid to and retained by Seller; and (c) Seller and Buyer shall have no further obligations to each other except those which survive the termination of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the damages to Seller in the event
of a breach of this Agreement by Buyer would be difficult or impossible to determine, that the amount of the deposit plus interest represents the parties best and most accurate estimate of the damages that would be suffered by Seller if the
transaction should fail to close and that such estimate is reasonable under the circumstances existing as of the date of this Agreement and under the circumstances that Seller and Buyer reasonably anticipate would exist at the time of such breach.
Buyer and Seller agree that Sellers right to retain the Deposit shall be Sellers sole remedy, at law and in equity, for Buyers failure to purchase the Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Seller hereby waives
any right to an action for specific performance of any provisions of this Agreement.  6.2 Seller Default. If the sale
contemplated hereby is not consummated because of a default by Seller in its obligation to sell the Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement after Buyer has performed or tendered performance of all of its material obligations in
accordance with this Agreement, Buyer shall have the right to exercise one of the following remedies:  6.2.1
Waive such failure and proceed to the Closing with no reduction in the Purchase Price, whereupon Seller and Buyer shall have no further obligations to each other. 
6.2.2 Pursue an action for specific performance, and if Buyer is finally successful in such action, Buyer shall have the
right to recover from Seller the sum of the actual and reasonable attorneys fees which Buyer incurred in connection therewith, but only up to the sum of $10,000.00, whereupon Seller and Buyer shall have no further obligations to each other.
  
21 


6.2.3 Terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller and Escrow Holder to that
effect and to recover the full amount of the Deposit (and any interest earned thereon), whereupon Seller and Buyer shall have no further obligations to each other. 
ARTICLE 7 - CASUALTY DAMAGE OR CONDEMNATION 
7.1 Casualty. If the Improvements are materially damaged by casualty prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have the sole option to
elect either to:  (a) acquire the Property as is (without reduction in the Purchase Price), plus an assignment
without recourse or credit of any insurance proceeds payable by virtue of such loss or damage plus a credit for any deductible or uninsured loss under said policy; or 
(b) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit (and any interest earned thereon). 
Such right must be exercised within thirty (30) days from the date Seller provides Buyer with notice of the loss of the event giving
rise to such right. If Buyer fails to provide notice of an election, then Buyer shall have been deemed to elect (b) above. 
7.2 Condemnation. In the event that any material portion of the Property should be condemned prior to the Closing, at Buyers
sole option, elect either to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit; or 
(b) close the transaction as contemplated by this Agreement. 
In all other cases, or if Buyer elects to proceed under Section 7.2(b), Buyer shall purchase the Property in accordance with the
terms hereof (without reduction in the Purchase Price) and Seller shall assign to Buyer at Closing all condemnation proceeds payable as a result of such condemnation. Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to proceed under
Section 7.2(a) unless, within thirty (30) days from written notice of the condemnation, Buyer provides Seller with written notice that Buyer elects to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.2(b).  ARTICLE 8 - REAL ESTATE COMMISSION 
6. Buyer and Seller each represent to the other that no brokers or real estate commissions or other fees are or shall be due in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder other than fees due to Investment Realty Advisors, Inc. (Broker). Broker shall be paid pursuant to a separate agreement with Seller. Each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the other from and against any and all claims, demands or the cost or expense thereof, including reasonable attorneys fees, arising out of any brokers commission, fee or other compensation due or alleged to be due in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon an agreement alleged to have been made or other action alleged to have been taken by the indemnifying party. 
 
22

regard to the principles of conflicts of law.  9.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of

9.9 IRS Real Estate Sales Reporting. Buyer and Seller agree that Escrow Holder shall
act as the person responsible for closing the transaction which is the subject of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6045(e) of the Code and shall prepare and file all informational returns, including without limitation, IRS

and which are consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.  9.13 Descriptive Headings; Word Meaning. The
descriptive headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any provisions of this Agreement. Words such as herein,
hereinafter, hereof and hereunder when used in reference to this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words appear, unless the context otherwise requires. The
singular shall include the plural and the masculine sender shall include the feminine and neuter, and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The word including shall not be restrictive and shall be interpreted as if followed
by the words without limitation.  9.14 Business Day. As used herein, the term business day
means any day other than Saturday, Sunday and any day which is a legal holiday in the State of Florida.  9.15 Construction
of Agreement. This Agreement shall not be construed more strictly against one party than against the other merely by virtue of the fact that it may have been prepared primarily by counsel for one of the parties, it being recognized that both
Buyer and Seller have contributed substantially and materially to the preparation of this Agreement.  9.16
Severability. The parties hereto intend and believe that each provision in this Agreement comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions. However, if any provision in this Agreement is found by a court of
law to be in violation of any applicable local, state or federal law, statute, ordinance, administrative or judicial decision, or public policy, or if in any other respect such a court declares any such provision to be illegal, invalid, unlawful,
void or unenforceable as written, then it is the intent of all parties hereto that, consistent with and with a view towards preserving the economic and legal arrangements among the parties hereto as expressed in this Agreement, such provision shall
be given force and effect to the fullest possible extent, and that the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable provision were not contained herein, and that the rights, obligations
and interests of the parties under the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.   
25 


9.17 Exclusivity. After the Effective Date, and continuing until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the date on which this Agreement is terminated by a party as provided herein, Seller and its respective agents, representatives and employees will abate all marketing efforts for the Land and Improvements. Any existing signs may
remain. Any ordered advertising will be canceled, if cancelable without penalty; otherwise ordered advertising may proceed, but no additional advertising will occur. Brokers and prospective buyers will not be shown the Land and Improvements and will
be given only currently available printed information about the Land and Improvements prepared by Sellers broker.  9.18
Section 1031 Exchange. Either party may consummate the purchase or sale of the Property as part of a so-called like kind exchange (an Exchange) pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code, provided that (i) the Closing
shall not be delayed or affected by reason of an Exchange nor shall the consummation or accomplishment of any Exchange be a condition precedent or condition subsequent to a partys obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any party desiring
an Exchange shall effect its Exchange through an assignment of this Agreement, or its rights under this Agreement, to a qualified intermediary and the other party shall not be required to take an assignment of the purchase agreement for the
relinquished or replacement property or be required to acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes of consummating such Exchange; and (iii) the party desiring an Exchange shall pay any additional costs that would not otherwise have
been incurred by Buyer or Seller had such party not consummated its purchase or sale through an Exchange. Neither party shall by this agreement or acquiescence to an Exchange desired by the other party (1) have its rights under this Agreement
affected or diminished in any manner or (2) be responsible for compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to the other party that such partys Exchange in fact complies with Section 1031 of the Code. In connection with such
cooperation, Seller agrees, upon request of Buyer to direct deed for actual interests in the property to designees of Buyer.  7.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.  8.

supersede any modification, amendment or alteration of the Account Agreement (whether executed prior to this Letter Agreement or after). No changes shall be made to the Account Agreement regarding the amount of or conditions to disbursement or any
other material terms.  The parties executing this Letter Agreement recognize and agree that Buyer is the third-party beneficiary of this
Letter Agreement. This Letter Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which is an original and all of which together constitute one document.
