THIS REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this Agreement) is entered into as of the 15th day of June, 2010 (the Effective
Date), by and between SBC ARCHWAY II, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (Seller), and BC DEVELOPMENT CO., LLC, a Missouri limited liability company or its assigns (Buyer), for the purchase of certain real
property more particularly described herein.  ARTICLE 1 - SALE OF PROPERTY 
1.1 Property To Be Sold. Subject to the terms and provisions hereof, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer and Buyer agrees to purchase
from Seller upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement:  1.1.1 All of the land described and/or shown on
Exhibit A attached hereto, together with all privileges, rights, easements and appurtenances belonging to such land, including without limitation, all right, title and interest (if any) of Seller in and to any streets,
alleys, passages, usufructs and other rights-of-way or appurtenances included in, adjacent to or used in connection with such land and all right, title and interest (if any) of Seller in all mineral and development rights appurtenant to such land
(collectively, the Land).  1.1.2 All buildings, structures and other improvements and all fixtures,
systems and facilities located on the Land (the Improvements).  1.1.3 All equipment, machinery,
signs and other tangible personal property of every kind and nature, if any, owned by Seller and installed, located or situated on or used in connection with the operation of the Land or Improvements, including, without limitation, the personal
property listed on Exhibit B attached hereto (the Personal Property). Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are no specific items of Personal Property located on the Land or Improvements that would not otherwise be
considered fixtures.  1.1.4 All of Sellers rights in the lease and any other occupancy
agreement covering any portion of the Land or Improvements (the Lease), including the lease listed on Exhibit C attached hereto and any leases that may be subsequently entered into in accordance with this
Agreement, and including Sellers rights to any tenant deposit held by Seller (the Tenant Deposit) pursuant to the Leases. 
1.1.5 All of Sellers right, title and interest, if any, in all intangible assets of any nature relating to the Land,
the Improvements or the Personal Property, including, without limitation, all of Sellers right, title, and interest in all (i) warranties and guaranties relating to the Improvements or Personal Property in the possession of Seller,
(ii) all use, occupancy, building and operating licenses, permits, approvals, and development rights (iii) any trade name or names used or utilized in connection with the Land and Improvements and (iv) all plans and specifications
related to the Land and Improvements, in each case to the extent that Seller may legally transfer the same (the Intangible Property).   
1 


1.1.6 All of Sellers rights, if any, in all service contracts (other
than management and leasing contracts) affecting the Land or Improvements as set forth on Exhibit D attached hereto (the Property Contracts), to the extent Buyer assumes the same in accordance with
Section 3.4 below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are no written Property Contracts connected with the Land or Improvements. Any agreements for services connected with the Land or Improvements are oral in nature and are in place from
month-to-month.  1.1.7 All rights, which the Seller may have, if any, in and to any tenant data,
telephone numbers and listings, all master keys and keys to common areas, all good will, if any, and any and all other rights, privileges and appurtenances owned by Seller and related to or used in connection with the existing business operation of
the Land and Improvements (the Miscellaneous Property).  1.1.8 The Land and Improvements are
hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the Real Property and the Real Property, Personal Property, Leases, Tenant Deposits, Intangible Property, the Property Contracts and the Miscellaneous Property, are hereinafter sometimes
referred to collectively as the Property.  1.2 Purchase and Sale. Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller and
Seller agrees to sell to Buyer all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Property, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
1.3 Purchase Price. 
1.3.1 The purchase price for the Property (the Purchase Price) shall be Seventeen Million Seven Hundred
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($17,700,000.00). The Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller by Buyer on the Closing Date (as defined below), plus or minus all adjustments or credits as set forth herein, by wire transfer of immediately available federal
funds.  1.3.2 Seller and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price was determined based on a projected net operating
income (Projected NOI) of One Million Four Hundred Sixty Thousand Six Hundred Twenty Two and No/100 Dollars ($1,460,622.00), and thus a capitalization rate of 8.25% (Capitalization Rate). During the Due Diligence Period (as
defined below), Buyer shall review the historic operating income and expense information of the Property and Buyer shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, the validity of the Projected NOI. Prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence
Period (as defined below), the Buyer shall either agree that the Projected NOI is the actual net operating income of the Property and the Purchase Price will remain unchanged or Buyer may request an amendment to the Purchase Price, which Seller may
accept or decline, in Sellers sole and absolute discretion.  1.3.3 During the Due Diligence Period (as
defined below), Buyer shall review the historical property tax information of the Property (the Historical Property Taxes), and Buyer shall determine the validity of such information and its impact on the net operating income of the
Property. Prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (as defined below), the Buyer shall either agree that the Historical Property Taxes do not alter the Propertys net operating income and the Purchase Price will remain unchanged or
Buyer may request an amendment to the Purchase Price, which Seller may accept or decline, in Sellers sole and absolute discretion.   
2 


1.4 Deposit. Within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Date, Buyer
shall deliver to Chicago Title Insurance Corporation, 830 East Main Street, Suite 1600, Richmond, VA 23219, Attn: Chris Newman (Escrow Holder), a good faith deposit in the amount of Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) (the
Initial Deposit), and within three (3) Business Days following the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (defined in Section 3.2), assuming Buyer has not previously terminated this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to Escrow
Holder an additional good faith deposit (Additional Deposit) of Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($50,000.00). The Initial Deposit and the Additional Deposit shall be collectively referred to as the Deposit. The Deposit shall be held in
an insured, interest-bearing account with interest accruing for the benefit of Buyer. The Deposit (including any interest thereon) shall be applied to the Purchase Price if the Closing occurs. After the expiration of the Due Diligence Period
(defined in Section 3.2), the Deposit shall be nonrefundable to Buyer unless escrow fails to close due to (i) Sellers breach or default under this Agreement, (ii) a failure of a representation or warranty by Seller to be true
and correct as of the Closing, (iii) a failure of a condition precedent set forth in Section 5.4, (iv) a casualty or condemnation, or (v) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, and the Deposit shall constitute
liquidated damages to Seller if escrow fails to close solely as a result of Buyers default as provided in Section 6.1 below. In the event Buyer shall elect to terminate this Agreement or be deemed to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the Deposit shall immediately be returned to Buyer as provided in Section 3.5 below.  1.5 Closing
Date.  1.5.1 The Closing shall take place through an escrow opened with Escrow Holder on or before the date
(the Closing Date) which is thirty (30) days after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (defined in Section 3.2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer has the right, upon five (5) Business Days notice to
Seller, to accelerate the Closing Date. In addition to the foregoing, the Buyer and Seller may elect to hold the Closing at such other place and on such other later date as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree in writing. For purposes of this
Agreement Close of Escrow or Closing means the date Escrow Holder disburses funds in accordance with this Agreement and is irrevocably committed to record the Deed in favor of Buyer. 
1.5.2 In addition to the foregoing, Buyer shall have the right to unilaterally extend the Closing Date from time to time,
not to exceed in the aggregate thirty (30) additional days beyond the Closing Date provided in Section 1.5.1 above provided that on or before the originally scheduled Closing Date Buyer provides written notice to the Seller (Closing
Extension Notice) and increases the Deposit by Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($50,000) (the Closing Extension Deposit). The Closing Extension Deposit shall be deemed part of the Deposit and shall be subject to terms and
conditions set forth in Section 1.4.   
3 


ARTICLE 2 - TITLE AND SURVEY 
2.1 Title and Survey. During the Due Diligence Period (defined in Section 3.2), Buyer, at Buyers cost and expense, may
obtain a preliminary title report or commitment (the Preliminary Report) from Chicago Title Insurance Corporation, 830 East Main Street, Suite 1600, Richmond, Virginia 23219, Attn: Chris Newman (the Title Company), together
with legible copies of all recorded encumbrances and exceptions to title as well as an existing survey, if any, from Seller. Buyer shall, at its option and at its expense, (i) conduct UCC searches covering Seller and the Property (the UCC
Searches) and (ii) order an update of the existing survey of the Real Property by a licensed surveyor or registered professional engineer (the Survey). 
2.2 Review of the Preliminary Report, Survey and UCC Searches; Objection; Approval or Termination. On or before the last day of
the Due Diligence Period, with respect to the Preliminary Report or within ten (10) days after delivery to Buyer of any supplement to the Preliminary Title Report (Supplemental Report), with respect only to matters not set forth in
the Preliminary Report but not set forth in the Supplemental Report, Buyer may deliver to Seller a notice (the Title Objection Notice) setting forth (i) any matters shown on the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey or UCC
Searches to which Buyer objects and requires be eliminated, (ii) any modifications, supplements or other modifications of the legal description, description of exceptions or other matters set forth in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report
or Survey, and (iii) any endorsements or other affirmative title insurance coverage required to be included in the Title Policy (collectively, clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) herein shall be referred to hereinafter as the Title
Objections). Buyer may make its determination of whether any of the matters contained in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey or UCC Searches (as applicable) are appropriate or are objectionable in its sole discretion.
Buyers failure to give the Title Objection Notice shall be deemed to constitute Buyers disapproval of matters disclosed in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey, or UCC Searches (as applicable) and this Agreement shall
terminate. If Buyer delivers a Title Objection Notice, Seller shall have five (5) Business Days from the receipt of Buyers notice (the Sellers Response Period) to provide Buyer with written notice of Sellers
election to remove or otherwise cure to Buyers satisfaction the Title Objections prior to the Closing (Seller Response Notice); provided however, and notwithstanding Buyers inclusion or lack thereof in any Title Objection
Notice, Seller shall be obligated to eliminate all monetary liens or encumbrances, and any exceptions created or consented to by Seller after the Effective Date (collectively, the Required Cure Items), unless approved in writing by
Buyer, which Seller shall cause to be released at Closing. With the exception of the Required Cure Items, if Seller fails to deliver the Seller Response Notice within the Seller Response Period, then Seller shall be deemed to have elected to cure
all of the disapproved matters set forth in Buyers Title Objection Notice. If Seller timely delivers notice of election not to cure a disapproved item, then Buyer may either (i) elect to terminate this Agreement, or (ii) waive in
writing its prior disapproval of such item and accept title subject to such previously disapproved item by delivering notice of Buyers election to Seller within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of the Seller Response Notice (the
Buyer Response Period). If Buyer fails to deliver its notice of election to terminate this Agreement within the Buyer Response Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved of Sellers Response Notice and any items Seller has elected not
to cure shall be deemed permitted as part of the Required Title Condition. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 2.2, the provisions of Section 3.5 shall apply. 
 
4 


2.3 Required Title Condition. Title to the Property shall be conveyed to Buyer
subject only to the following permitted encumbrances: (a) current, non-delinquent real estate taxes and assessments, (B) the matters set forth in the Preliminary Report and permitted as part of the Required Title Condition, (c) the
Lease, and (d) any other matters approved in writing by Buyer.  ARTICLE 3 - INSPECTION AND DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD 
 3.1 Access. From and after the Effective Date through the Closing, Buyer, personally or through its authorized agent
or representatives, shall be entitled, upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, to enter upon the Property during normal business hours and shall have the right to make such investigations, including tenant interviews, appraisals, engineering
studies, soil tests, environmental studies and underwriting analyses, as Buyer deems reasonably necessary or advisable. Buyer shall have the right to conduct a Phase I environmental site assessment, and, if necessary, a Phase II environmental site
assessment (including soils borings, soil sampling and, if relevant, ground water testing, and invasive sampling of building materials with respect to the Property). Buyers activities at the Property shall be conducted in such a manner so as
not to unreasonably interfere with the occupancy of the tenant or its employees, licensees or invitees. Regarding Buyers investigations, in addition to the forgoing: 
a. Upon Sellers request, Buyer must deliver evidence to Seller that Buyer has insurance for its proposed inspection
activities, in amounts and with coverages that are substantially the same as those maintained by Seller or in such lesser amounts or with such lesser coverages as are reasonably satisfactory to Seller; 
b. Buyer must notify Seller in advance of Buyers plans to conduct tests so that Seller may be present during the
tests;  c. if the Land or Improvements are altered because of Buyers inspections, Buyer must return the
Land or Improvements to their pre-inspection condition promptly after the alteration occurs;  d. Buyer must
deliver to Seller copies of all inspection reports that Buyer prepares or receives from third-party consultants or contractors within three (3) days after their preparation or receipt; 
e. Buyer must abide by any other reasonable entry rules imposed by Seller; 
f. Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold Seller harmless from any loss, reasonable attorneys fees, expenses, or
claims arising out of Buyers investigation of the Land or Improvements, except repair or remediation of existing conditions discovered by Buyers inspections. Furthermore, Buyer agrees to keep the Property free from mechanics lien
claims related to Buyers investigative work under this Article 3. The obligations of Buyer under this provision will survive termination of this Agreement and Closing; and 
 
5 


g. Buyer releases Seller and those persons acting on Sellers behalf
from all claims and causes of action (including claims for attorneys fees and court and other costs) resulting from Buyers investigation of the Land or Improvements. 
3.2 Due Diligence Period. Buyer shall have sixty (60) days from the later of (i) the Effective Date or (ii) the
date on which Buyer receives all of the Property Information (as defined in Section 3.3) (the Due Diligence Period) to physically inspect the Property, review the economic data, underwrite the tenants and review the Leases, conduct
appraisals, perform examinations of the physical condition of the Improvements, examine the Property for the presence of Hazardous Materials (as defined below), and to otherwise conduct such due diligence review of the Property and all of the items
to be furnished by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3 below, and all records and other materials related thereto as Buyer deems appropriate. 
3.3 Items to be Provided by Seller. No later than one (1) Business Day after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer (by electronic or overnight delivery) accurate and complete copies of all of the information set forth on Exhibit G attached hereto and incorporated herein (Property Information). In addition to the foregoing
deliveries, Seller shall make available to Buyer for inspection and copying at Sellers offices in Greenwood, Colorado the originals of any of the Property Information and any and all other documents, instruments, studies, reports, surveys,
maps, files, correspondence (including without limitation, tenant correspondence files), reports and other materials related to the Property and not included in the Property Information. Seller agrees to update, provide and make available to Buyer
new Property Information as it becomes available. Where financial statements are required, Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to have its auditor, BDO Seidman, LLP, or another qualified auditor of
Buyers choosing conduct an audit of the property financial statements and other information. Where financial statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), to the extent Seller does
not have such financial statements, Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation), at its sole cost and expense, to have its accountants prepare Sellers financial statements in accordance with GAAP. 
3.4 Termination of Property Contracts. Prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall notify Seller of any
Property Contract which Buyer wishes to retain and assume as of the Closing. Unless otherwise expressly agreed to by Buyer, all Property Contracts, including without limitation all property management agreements and leasing agreements, shall be
terminated by Seller, at Sellers expense, as of the Closing Date.  3.5 Buyers Possible Early Termination.
Buyer shall have the right to approve in Buyers sole and absolute discretion, the Property, the Property Information, the Preliminary Report, any Supplemental Report, the Survey, the UCC Searches, or any other matter whatsoever regarding the
Property. On or before the last day of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall   
6 



provide written notice (Disapproval Notice) to Seller and Escrow Holder that Buyer has disapproved the Property. Buyers failure to provide a Disapproval Notice upon the
expiration of the Due Diligence Period shall be deemed an approval of the Property. At any time prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer may provide a Disapproval Notice to Seller and Escrow Holder disapproving the Property. Upon
the giving of a Disapproval Notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and the provisions of Section 3.6 shall apply. 
3.6 Consequences of Buyers Early Termination. Upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.2 or
Section 3.5, this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and the parties shall be released from all further obligations under this Agreement (except with respect to any provisions that by their terms survive a termination of this Agreement);
provided, however, that if Seller is in default hereunder at the time of such termination, Section 6.2 shall additionally apply. Provided Buyer is not then in default under the terms of this Agreement, Escrow Holder shall pay the entire Deposit
(including any interest thereon) to Buyer not later than one (1) Business Day following receipt of Buyers Disapproval Notice (as long as the then-current investment of the Deposit can be liquidated in one (1) Business Day).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any event, Escrow Holder shall not be required to obtain the consent of any party to release the Deposit to Buyer in accordance with this Section 3.6. 
ARTICLE 4 - REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS 
4.1 Sellers Representations. Except as otherwise disclosed in writing to Buyer, Seller warrants and represents to Buyer as
follows:  4.1.1 Seller is a duly formed and validly existing limited liability company organized under the laws
of Colorado. Seller has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all documents contemplated
hereby by Seller have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller and all required consents and approvals have been duly obtained and will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute
a default under any indenture, agreement or instrument to which Seller is a party. This Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. 
4.1.2 Seller has good and marketable title to the Property. There are no outstanding rights of first refusal, rights of
reverter or options to purchase relating to the Property or any interest therein. To Sellers knowledge, there are no unrecorded or undisclosed documents or other matters which affect title to the Property. Subject to the Leases, Seller has
enjoyed the continuous and uninterrupted quiet possession, use and operation of the Property, without material complaint or objection by any person. 
4.1.3 Seller is not a foreign person within the meaning of Section 1445(f) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the Code).   
7 


4.1.4 Neither Seller nor any of its affiliates, nor any of their respective
partners, members, shareholders or other equity owners, and none of their respective employees, officers, directors, representatives or agents is, nor will they become, a person or entity with whom United States persons or entities are restricted
from doing business under regulations of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury (including those named on OFACs Specially Designated and Blocked Persons List) or under any statute, executive
order (including, without limitation, the September 24, 2001, Executive Order Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism), or other governmental action, and is not and will
not engage in any dealings or transactions or be otherwise associated with such persons or entities.  4.1.5 The
authorization, consent, and approval of a governmental authority is required for the Closing herein described to occur. However, Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval within fifteen (15) days of the Effective Date
of this Agreement.  4.1.6 There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or, to the best of Sellers
knowledge, threatened (a) affecting Seller, which if determined adversely, would affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder; or (b) against any portion of the Property. 
4.1.7 Seller has not (a) made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (b) filed any voluntary
petition in bankruptcy or suffered the filing of an involuntary petition by Sellers creditors, (c) suffered the appointment of a receiver to take possession of all or substantially all of Sellers assets, (d) suffered the
attachment or other judicial seizure of all, or substantially all, of Sellers assets, (e) admitted in writing its inability to pay its debts as they come due, or (f) made an offer of settlement, extension or composition to its
creditors generally.  4.1.8 To the best of Sellers knowledge, neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement nor compliance herewith (a) conflicts or will conflict with or results or will result in a breach of or constitutes or will constitute a default under (i) the articles of incorporation and by-laws or other
organization certificate and/or partnership or operating agreement of Seller, or (ii) any law or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority, or (b) results in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge
or encumbrance upon its property pursuant to any such agreement or instrument.  4.1.9 Seller has not entered
into any material commitments or agreements with any governmental authorities or agencies affecting the Property except as provided in the Property Information. 
4.1.10 There is no pending, threatened or contemplated condemnation proceeding relating to the Property to the best of
Sellers knowledge, and Seller has received no written notice from any governmental agency or official to the effect that any such proceeding is contemplated. 
4.1.11 Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer a complete copy of the Lease and other occupancy agreements
affecting the Property. The Lease is in full force and effect. Seller is landlord or lessor under and is entitled to assign to Buyer, without tenants consent (subject to Section 4.1.5, above), the Lease at Closing.
Neither Seller nor the tenant   
8 



shall be in default under the Lease and at Closing there will exist no condition or circumstance or written notice of any condition or circumstance which, with the passage of time, would
constitute a default of either Seller or the tenant. The tenant is not asserting any claim of offset or other defense in respect of its or Sellers obligations under the Lease, and there are no unresolved disputes relating to the calculation of
additional rent under the Lease. There are no pending or incomplete tenant improvements and unpaid tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions with respect to the Lease and no pecuniary obligation to tenant and brokers has vested or accrued and
is owed by Seller, except that shall be fully completed and paid in full prior to Closing.  4.1.12 The
financial statements of Property operations provided by Seller, including, but not limited to, statements of revenue and expenses, balance sheets and statements of cash flow are true, correct and complete in all material respects. Such financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the information contained therein for the periods indicated therein. All expenses associated with Property operations have been recorded in Sellers general ledger. Seller agrees to provide
such other reasonable information requested by Buyer provided such request may not delay the Closing.  4.1.13
Seller agrees to make such further and other reasonable representations and warranties regarding the financial statements of the Property and the Seller, including, but not limited to representations and warranties related to statements of revenue
and expenses, and Sellers internal controls for the prevention and detection of fraud, as may be reasonably required of Seller by Buyers auditor. Seller further agrees to reasonably cooperate with Buyers auditor in connection with
delivery of any audit opinions or comfort letters relating to audited financial statements prepared by Buyers Auditor and consents to the dissemination of any such audited financial statements, opinions or letters as may be required by Buyer
or its auditor for any purpose, including but not limited to their inclusion in any registration statements, prospectuses, or similar documents in connection with syndications, private placements or public offerings of securities or interest by
Buyer, or any of Buyers affiliates or assigns and any reporting requirements for the same under applicable federal and state laws. All costs and expenses associated with any reports, opinions or letters required by this section shall be borne
by Buyer.  4.1.14 Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer true and complete copies of all management
and leasing contracts to which Seller is a party and affecting the Property and, to the best of Sellers knowledge, all other contracts, agreements, documents, reports, materials and information that are in Sellers possession or control
with respect to the ownership, use and/or operation of the Property. Seller has not, within the last year, received any written notice of any default under any Property Contract or other such contract or agreement that has not been cured or waived.
 4.1.15 There are no debts or other liabilities or obligations relating to the Lease or the Property, including

of a breach of this Agreement by Buyer would be difficult or impossible to determine, that the amount of the deposit plus interest represents the parties best and most accurate estimate of the damages that would be suffered by Seller if the
transaction should fail to close and that such estimate is reasonable under the circumstances existing as of the date of this Agreement and under the circumstances that Seller and Buyer reasonably anticipate would exist at the time of such breach.
Buyer and Seller agree that Sellers right to retain the Deposit together with any interest and earnings earned thereon shall be Sellers sole remedy, at law and in equity, for Buyers failure to purchase the Property in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Seller hereby waives any right to an action for specific performance of any provisions of this Agreement. 
6.2 Sellers Default. If prior to Closing Seller fails to perform any of its obligations or is otherwise in default
hereunder, Buyer shall have the right to exercise any or all of the following remedies:  6.2.1 Waive such
failure and proceed to the Closing with no reduction in the Purchase Price; provided, however, that this provision will not waive or affect Sellers indemnity obligations under this Agreement or Buyers rights to enforce those indemnity
obligations, nor waive or affect any of Sellers other obligations under this Agreement to be performed after the Closing or Buyers rights to enforce those obligations. 
6.2.2 Terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller and Escrow Holder to that effect, to recover the full amount of the
Deposit (including any interest thereon).  ARTICLE 7 - CASUALTY DAMAGE OR CONDEMNATION 
7.1 Casualty. If the Improvements are damaged by casualty prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have the sole option to elect either
to:  (a) acquire the Property as is (without reduction in the Purchase Price), plus an assignment without
recourse or credit of any insurance proceeds payable by virtue of such loss or damage plus a credit for any deductible or uninsured loss under said policy; or 
(b) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit. 
 
21 


Such right must be exercised within ninety (90) days from the date
Seller provides Buyer with notice of the loss of the event giving rise to such right. If Buyer fails to provide notice of an election, then Buyer shall have been deemed to elect (b) above. 
7.2 Condemnation. In the event that any portion of the Property should be condemned prior to the Closing, at Buyers sole
option, elect either to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit; or 
(b) close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 
In all other cases, or if Buyer elects to proceed under Section 7.2(b), Buyer shall purchase the Property in accordance with the
terms hereof (without reduction in the Purchase Price) and Seller shall assign to Buyer at Closing all condemnation proceeds payable as a result of such condemnation. Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to proceed under
Section 7.2(a) unless, within ninety (90) days from written notice of the condemnation, Buyer provides Seller with written notice that Buyer elects to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.2(b).  ARTICLE 8 - REAL ESTATE COMMISSION 
Buyer and Seller each represent to the other that no brokers or real estate commissions or other fees are or shall be due in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder other than a commission payable to Daniel Mackey of the Mackey Company (collectively, the Broker). Buyer agrees to pay any brokers or real estate commissions or other fees
owed to Broker in accordance with a separate agreement between Buyer and Broker. Each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other from and against any and all claims, demands or the cost or expense thereof, including reasonable
attorneys fees, arising out of any brokers commission, fee or other compensation due or alleged to be due in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon an agreement alleged to have been made or other
action alleged to have been taken by the indemnifying party.  ARTICLE 9 - MISCELLANEOUS 
9.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein, and it supersedes all prior discussions, understandings or agreements between the parties. All Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto are a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein by reference.

through the ownership of voting securities or otherwise, and any other   
22 



assignment is void. No such assignment will relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement, and Buyer and the assignee will be jointly and severally liable for the performance of such
obligations after any such assignment. This Agreement binds, benefits, and may be enforced by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 
9.4 Waiver. The excuse or waiver of the performance by a party of any obligation of the other party under this Agreement shall
only be effective if evidenced by a written statement signed by the party so excusing or waiving. No delay in exercising any right or remedy shall constitute a waiver thereof, and no waiver by Seller or Buyer of the breach of any covenant of this
Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other covenant or condition of this Agreement. 
9.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the internal laws of the State of Illinois, without
regard to the principles of conflicts of law.  9.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of

9.13 Descriptive Headings; Word Meaning. The descriptive headings of the
paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any provisions of this Agreement. Words such as herein, hereinafter, hereof and
hereunder when used in reference to this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words appear, unless the context otherwise requires. The singular shall include the plural and the
masculine sender shall include the feminine and neuter, and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The word including shall not be restrictive and shall be interpreted as if followed by the words without
limitation.  9.14 Business Day. As used herein, the term Business Day means any day other than
Saturday, Sunday and any day which is a legal holiday in the State of Illinois.  9.15 Construction of Agreement. This
Agreement shall not be construed more strictly against one party than against the other merely by virtue of the fact that it may have been prepared primarily by counsel for one of the parties, it being recognized that both Buyer and Seller have
contributed substantially and materially to the preparation of this Agreement.  9.16 Severability. The parties hereto
intend and believe that each provision in this Agreement comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions. However, if any provision in this Agreement is found by a court of law to be in violation of any applicable
local, state or federal law, statute, ordinance, administrative or judicial decision, or public policy, or if in any other respect such a court declares any such provision to be illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written, then it
is the intent of all parties hereto that, consistent with and with a view towards preserving the economic and legal arrangements among the parties hereto as expressed in this Agreement, such provision shall be given force and effect to the fullest
possible extent, and that the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable provision were not contained herein, and that the rights, obligations and interests of the parties under the
remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  9.17 Exclusivity. After the Effective Date,
Seller and its respective agents, representatives and employees will abate all marketing efforts for the Land and Improvements. Any existing signs may remain. Any ordered advertising will be canceled, if cancelable without penalty; otherwise ordered
advertising may proceed, but no additional advertising will occur. Brokers and prospective buyers will not be shown the Land and Improvements and will be given only currently available printed information about the Land and Improvements prepared by
Sellers broker.  9.18 Section 1031 Exchange. Either party may consummate the purchase or sale of the
Property as part of a so-called like kind exchange (an Exchange) pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code, provided that (i) the Closing shall not be delayed or affected by reason of an Exchange
  
25 



nor shall the consummation or accomplishment of any Exchange be a condition precedent or condition subsequent to a partys obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any party desiring an
Exchange shall effect its Exchange through an assignment of this Agreement, or its rights under this Agreement, to a qualified intermediary and the other party shall not be required to take an assignment of the purchase agreement for the
relinquished or replacement property or be required to acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes of consummating such Exchange; and (iii) the party desiring an Exchange shall pay any additional costs that would not otherwise have
been incurred by Buyer or Seller had such party not consummated its purchase or sale through an Exchange. Neither party shall by this agreement or acquiescence to an Exchange desired by the other party (1) have its rights under this Agreement
affected or diminished in any manner or (2) be responsible for compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to the other party that such partys Exchange in fact complies with Section 1031 of the Code. In connection with such
cooperation, Seller agrees, upon request of Buyer to direct deed for actual interests in the property to designees of Buyer. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.
