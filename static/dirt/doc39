At Closing, Buyer shall assume the loan (the Loan Assumption) evidenced by a note in the

(collectively with any successors and assigns, the Existing Lender), and is evidence and/or

to assume the Loan. Seller shall pay all costs, fees and expenses in connection with attempting to
obtain Existing Lenders approval of the assumption of the Loan (collectively, the Loan Assumption
Related Fees). In connection with such approval, the parties shall diligently, promptly and in
good faith attempt to obtain such approval and both parties will supply the information reasonably
requested by Existing Lender with respect to such approval. This Agreement shall automatically

contrary, Seller shall be obligated, at its sole cost and expense, to satisfy at or prior to
Closing all monetary encumbrances effecting the Property evidenced by deeds of trust, tax liens,
judgments, mechanics liens, or other liens or charges in a fixed sum, and Seller authorizes the
use of the Purchase Price or a portion thereof to pay and discharge the same at Closing.


ARTICLE 3
INSPECTION AND DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD
3.1 Access
From and after the Effective Date through the Closing, (a) Buyer, personally or through its
authorized agent or representatives, shall be entitled, upon reasonable advance notice to Seller,
to enter upon the Property during normal business hours (and without disruption to any tenant on
the Property) and shall have the right to make such investigations, including appraisals, tenant
interviews, interviews of government officials, engineering studies, soil tests, environmental
studies and underwriting analyses, as Buyer deems necessary or advisable, and (b) Seller shall, at
Sellers expense, turn on, run, and maintain, with any interruption in service, electrical power
and all utilities to the Property (including without limitation plumbing, heating and air
conditioning systems) to facilitate Buyers testing and investigations thereof. Buyer shall have
the right to conduct a Phase I environmental site assessment, and, if necessary, a Phase II
environmental site assessment (including soils borings, soil sampling and, if relevant, ground
water testing, and invasive sampling of building materials with respect to the Property). Buyer
hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Seller (and Sellers agents, advisors, partners, members,
owners, officers and directors, as the case may be) harmless from any physical damages arising out
of all inspections and investigations by Buyer or its agents or independent contractors, but in no
event shall the indemnity of this Section include the discovery of pre-existing conditions
disclosed by Buyers investigations. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, this indemnification shall survive the termination of or Closing under this Agreement.
Buyer shall provide copies to Seller of any and all reports or other written investigation
materials as a result of Buyers review of the Property.


3.2 Due Diligence Period
Buyer shall have from the Effective Date until the date that is thirty (30) days after the
Effective Date (such period being the Due Diligence Period) to physically inspect the Property,
review the economic data, conduct appraisals, perform examinations of the physical condition of the
Improvements, examine the Property for the presence of Hazardous Materials (as defined below), and
to otherwise conduct such due diligence review of the Property and all of the items to be furnished
by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3 below, and all records and other materials related
thereto as Buyer deems appropriate.


3.3 Items to be Provided by Seller

the Property, the Property Information, or any other matter whatsoever regarding the Property. At
any time prior to or on the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer may provide written
notice to Seller disapproving the Property for purposes of this Article 3 (Disapproval Notice).
Unless Buyer provides Seller with the Disapproval Notice prior to the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period, Buyer waives its rights to terminate under this provision. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the non delivery of the Disapproval Notice shall not be deemed to
be a waiver by Buyer of any other rights of termination it may have as set forth herein.


3.6 Consequences of Buyers Early Termination
Unless Buyer provides a Disapproval Notice to Seller pursuant to Section 3.5, this Agreement
shall immediately terminate upon the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, and the parties shall

provisions that by their terms survive a termination of this Agreement); provided, however, that if
Seller is in default hereunder at the time of such termination, Section 6.2 shall additionally
apply. Escrow Agent shall pay the entire Deposit to Buyer not later than one (1) Business Day
following termination of this Agreement. No notice to Escrow Agent from Seller shall be required
for the release of the Deposit to Buyer by Escrow Agent under this Section, and the Deposit shall

the cost of appraisals, updated survey, architectural, engineering, credit and environmental
reports, and (ii) all title insurance premiums. Seller shall pay (a) the cost to deliver a title
insurance commitment (except as set forth above), and (b) all transfer, assumption or waiver fees
associated with any association, declarant or easement holder that holds any right in the Property
unless otherwise set forth herein. Buyer and Seller shall share equally the cost of (a) all
transfer taxes and documentary stamp charges of any jurisdiction, (b) recording fees, and (c) all
escrow charges. Any and all other purchase and sale closing costs shall be paid in accordance with
the custom of the local jurisdiction in which the Property is located.


5.8.2 Prorations. The following shall be prorated, credited, debited and adjusted
between Seller and Buyer as of 12:01 a.m. on the day of the Closing (except as otherwise provided)
in accordance with this section. For purposes of calculating prorations, Buyer shall be deemed to
be in title to the Property, and therefore entitled to the income and responsible for the expenses,
for the entire day upon which the Closing occurs. Except as hereinafter expressly provided, all
prorations shall be done on the basis of a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year and the actual
number of days elapsed to the Closing Date or the actual number of days in the month in which the
Closing occurs and the actual number of days elapsed in such month to the Closing Date, as
applicable.


(a) Rents. Buyer will receive a credit at closing for all rents collected by Seller
prior to the Closing Date and allocable to the period from and after the Closing Date based upon
the actual number of days in the month. No credit shall be given Seller for accrued and unpaid rent
or any other non-current sums due from tenants until these sums are paid, and Seller shall retain
the right to collect any such rent and, if a legal action has been commenced by Seller before the
close of Escrow, Seller may continue to pursue such legal action, provided Seller does not sue to
evict any tenants or terminate any Tenant Leases. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller after the
Closing Date to collect any rent under the Tenant Leases which has accrued as of the Closing Date;
provided, however, Buyer shall not be obligated to sue any tenants or exercise any legal remedies
under the Tenant Leases or to incur any expense over and above its own regular collection expenses.
All payments collected from tenants after the Closing Date shall first be applied to the month in
which the Closing occurs, then to any rent due to Buyer for the period after the Closing Date and
finally to any rent due to Seller for the periods prior to Closing Date; provided, however,
notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller collects any payments from tenants after the Closing Date
through its own collection efforts, Seller may first apply such payments to rent due Seller for the
period prior to the Closing Date.


(b) CAM Expenses. To the extent that tenants are reimbursing the landlord for common
area maintenance and other operating expenses (collectively, CAM Charge(s)), CAM Charges shall be
prorated at Closing and again subsequent to Closing, as of the Closing Date on a lease-by-lease
basis with each party being entitled to receive a portion of the CAM Charges payable under each
Tenant Lease for the CAM Lease Year (as defined below) in which Closing occurs, which portion shall
be equal to the actual CAM Charges incurred during the partys respective periods of ownership of
the Property during the CAM Lease Year. As used herein, the term CAM Lease Year means the twelve
(12) month period as to which annual CAM Charges are owed under each Tenant Lease. Five (5) days
prior to the Closing Date Seller shall submit to Buyer an itemization of its actual CAM Charge
expenses through such date and the amount of CAM Charges received by Seller as of such date,
together with an estimate of CAM charges to be incurred to, but not including, the Closing Date, In
the event that Seller has received CAM Charge payments in excess of its actual CAM Charge expenses,
Buyer shall be entitled to receive a credit against the Purchase Price for the excess. In the event
that Seller has received CAM Charge payments less than its actual CAM Charge expenses, to the
extent that the Tenant Leases provide for a true up at the end of the CAM lease Year, Seller
shall be entitled to receive any deficit but only after Buyer has received any true up payment from
the tenant. Upon receipt by either party of any CAM Charge true up payment from a tenant, the party
receiving the same shall provide to the other party its allocable share of the true up payment
within five (5) days of the receipt thereof. To assist Buyer in preparing the true up
reconciliation at the end of the CAM Lease Year, Seller shall deliver to Buyer an approved CAM
reconciliation up to but not including the Closing Date within thirty (30) days after Closing.


(c) Security Deposits, Unpaid Rent Concessions, Unpaid Tenant Improvement Allowances and
Other Tenant Credits. The amount of all unapplied tenant security deposit, any accrued
interest due any tenant thereon, unpaid rent concessions due under any Tenant Lease, unpaid tenant
improvement allowances owing under any Tenant Lease and the amount of any other credits due any
tenant shall be credited to Buyer based on a rental statement prepared by Seller and approved by
Buyer (which statement must be consistent with its respective Tenant Lease, the estoppel
certificate and the final rent roll).


(d) Property Taxes. All real property taxes that were due and payable in any year
prior to the year of Closing, shall be paid by Seller on or before the Closing. Real property
taxes and special assessments certified for payment therewith that are due and payable for the year
of Closing shall be prorated on the basis of the most recent assessment and levy. Buyer shall be
responsible for all property taxes and special assessments certified therewith in all years
following the year of Closing. If the most recent tax assessment and levy is not for the current
tax year, then the parties shall reprorate within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the tax
assessment and levy for the current tax year. If after the Closing there is any retroactive
increase in the real or personal property taxes or assessments imposed of the Property: (1) if such
increase relates to taxes or special assessments due and payable in the year in which the Closing
occurred, then such increase shall be prorated by Seller and Buyer on a per diem basis based on
their respective periods of ownership during their period to which such increase applies, (2) if
such increase relates to taxes or special assessments applied to any year subsequent to the year
which the Closing occurred, then such increase shall be the obligation of Buyer, and (3) if such
increase relates to taxes or special assessments applied to any year prior to the year in which the
Closing occurred, then such increase shall be the obligation of Seller. Any and all refunds,
credits, claims or rights to appeal respecting the amount of any real property taxes or other taxes
or assessments charged in connection with the Property for any period shall belong to Buyer
following the Closing, except that if prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period Seller has
applied for a property tax refund or has appealed the County Assessors valuation of the Property
for any period of time prior to the Closing Date, then Seller shall be entitled to any refund
applicable to such period. Buyer shall assume any and all other levied or pending special
assessments as of the Closing Date related to the Real Property.


(e) Private Assessments. Payments due under any assessments imposed by private
covenant shall be prorated as of the Closing.


(f) Operating Expenses. All operating expenses (including all charges under the
Service Contracts and agreements assumed by Buyer) shall be prorated, and as to each service
provider, operating expenses payable or paid to such service provider in respect to the billing
period of such service provider in which the Closing occurs (the Current Billing Period), shall
be prorated on a per diem basis based upon the number of days in the Current Billing Period prior
to the Close Date and the number of days in the Current Billing Period from and after the Closing
Date, and assuming that all charges are incurred uniformly during the Current Billing Period. If
actual bills for the Current Billing Period are unavailable as of the Closing Date, then such
proration shall be made on an estimated basis based upon the most recently issued bills, subject to
readjustment upon receipt of actual bills.


(g) Leasing Commissions. At Closing, Buyer shall receive a credit for any tenant
improvement costs, leasing commissions or rent concessions for any Tenant Lease that have not been
fully utilized at Closing, including without limitation, those applicable to the CPM Lease
Amendment.


(h) Items Not Prorated. Seller and Buyer agree that (a) on the Closing Date, the

none of the insurance policies relating to the Property will be assigned to Buyer and Buyer shall
be responsible for arranging for its own insurance as of the Closing Date; and (c) utilities,
including telephone, electricity, water, and gas, shall be read on the Closing Date and Buyer shall
be responsible for all the necessary actions needed to arrange for utilities to be transferred to
the name of Buyer on the Closing Date, including the posting of any required deposits and Seller
shall be entitled to recover and retain from the providers of such utilities any refunds or
overpayments to the extent applicable to the period prior to the Closing Date, and any utility
deposits which it or its predecessors may have posted. Accordingly, there will be no prorations for
debt service, insurance or utilities. In the event a meter reading is unavailable for any
particular utility, such utility shall be prorated in the manner provide.

provision of this Agreement to be prorated or adjusted.

than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date an estimated closing statement which shall
set forth all costs payable, and the prorations and credits provided for in this Agreement and to
the extent Seller does not timely deliver the estimated closing statement to Buyer, Buyer shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the Closing Date by the number of days Seller is
delinquent in delivering such estimated closing statement to Buyer. Any item which cannot be
finally prorated because of the unavailability of information shall be tentatively prorated on the
basis of the best data then available and adjusted when the information is available in accordance
with this subsection. Buyer shall notify Seller within two (2) days after its receipt of such
estimated closing statement of any items which Buyer disputes and the parties shall attempt in good
faith to reconcile any differences not later than one (1) day before the Closing Date. The
estimated closing statement as adjusted as aforesaid and approved in writing by the parties shall
be referred to therein as the Closing Statement. If the prorations and credits made under the
Closing Statement shall prove to be incorrect or incomplete for any reason, then either party shall
be entitled to an adjustment to correct the same; provided, however, that any adjustment shall be
made, if at all, within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date except with respect to CAM Charges,
taxes and assessments, in which case such adjustment shall be made within sixty (60) days after the
information necessary to perform such adjustment is available), and if a party fails to request an
adjustment to the Closing Statement by a written notice delivered to the other party within the

and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any provisions of this Agreement.
Words such as herein, hereinafter, hereof and hereunder when used in reference to this

parties, it being recognized that both Buyer and Seller have contributed substantially and
materially to the preparation of this Agreement.


9.16 Severability
The parties hereto intend and believe that each provision in this Agreement comports with all
applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions. However, if any provision in this
Agreement is found by a court of law to be in violation of any applicable local, state or federal
law, statute, ordinance, administrative or judicial decision, or public policy, or if in any other
respect such a court declares any such provision to be illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or
unenforceable as written, then it is the intent of all parties hereto that, consistent with and
with a view towards preserving the economic and legal arrangements among the parties hereto as
expressed in this Agreement, such provision shall be given force and effect to the fullest possible
extent, and that the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid,
unlawful, void or unenforceable provision were not contained herein, and that the rights,
obligations and interests of the parties under the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect.


9.17 Exclusivity
After the Effective Date, Seller and its respective agents, representatives and employees
shall immediately cease all marketing of the Property until such time as this Agreement is
terminated and Seller shall not directly or indirectly make, accept, negotiate, entertain or
otherwise pursue any offers for the sale of the Property.


9.18 Section 1031 Exchange
Either party may consummate the purchase or sale of the Property as part of a so-called like
kind exchange (an Exchange) pursuant to section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code), provided that (i) the Closing shall not be delayed or affected by reason of
an Exchange nor shall the consummation or accomplishment of any Exchange be a condition precedent
or condition subsequent to a partys obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any party desiring an
Exchange shall effect its Exchange through an assignment of this Agreement, or its rights under
this Agreement, to a qualified intermediary and the other party shall not be required to take an
assignment of the purchase agreement for the relinquished or replacement property or be required to
acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes of consummating such Exchange; and
(iii) the party desiring an Exchange shall pay any additional costs that would not otherwise have
been incurred by Buyer or Seller had such party not consummated its purchase or sale through an
Exchange. Neither party shall by this agreement or acquiescence to an Exchange desired by the
other party (1) have its rights under this Agreement affected or diminished in any manner or (2) be
responsible for compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to the other party that such partys
Exchange in fact complies with section 1031 of the Code. In connection with such cooperation,
Seller agrees, upon request of Buyer to direct deed for actual interests in the property to
designees of Buyer.


9.19 Cooperation with S-X 3-14 Audit
The Seller acknowledges that Buyer intends to assign all of its rights, title and interest in
and to this Agreement.  The assignee may be a publicly registered company (Registered Company)
promoted by the Buyer.  The Seller acknowledges that it has been advised that if the purchaser is a

Exchange Commission (the SEC Filings) that relate to the most recent pre-acquisition fiscal year

stub period; (iv) access to the general ledger for the Year and stub period; (v) cash receipts

along with an explanation for all accounts over 30 days past due as of the end of the Year and stub
period; (xii) signed representation letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, and (xiv) to
the extent necessary, a signed audit letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F.

and regulations, including but not limited to, regulations promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the
