only the certifications (the Required Certifications) required by the Lease between Seller and Orbcomm (the Orbcomm Lease), then the condition to closing set forth in Section 5.1.6 will be deemed
satisfied if Seller delivers a seller estoppel certificate (a Seller Estoppel), dated as of the Closing Date, certifying to the statements contained in the attached Orbcomm Estoppel other than the Required Certifications. For
purposes of clarity, the parties agree that the Seller shall determine in its sole discretion whether to provide a Seller Estoppel and Seller shall have no obligation to provide a Seller Estoppel. If, after closing, Seller delivers an estoppel
certificate from Orbcomm which certifies the same information as certified in the Seller Estoppel, then such Seller Estoppel shall terminate and Seller shall have no further liability based thereon. The statements by Seller contained in the Seller
Estoppel shall be deemed to be 
  26 




 
 
representations of Seller and shall be subject to all of the limitations on Sellers liability as set forth in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, Section 8.4.

7.6.9
Estimating taxes. With respect to Real Estate Taxes, in the event that as of the Closing Date the actual tax bills for the tax year or other tax billing period
in question are not available and the amount of taxes to be prorated as aforesaid cannot be ascertained, then rates and assessed valuations of the previous year or other tax billing period, with known changes, shall be used; and after the Closing
Date and when the actual amount of taxes for the year or other tax billing periods in question shall be determinable, such taxes shall be re-prorated between the parties to reflect the actual amount of such taxes.

Others. All other prorations, and adjustments to initial estimated prorations, shall be made by Purchaser and Seller with due diligence and cooperation within
thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, or such later time as may be required to obtain necessary information for proration, by cash payment to the party yielding a net credit from such prorations from the other party. Such cash payment
shall be made within ten (10) business days of demand for payment by the party entitled to receive such payment. If as a result of any appeal by Purchaser of the assessed valuation of the Property, the assessed valuation is reduced for any tax
year, to the extent not payable to a tenant under a lease at the Property, (i) Purchaser shall be entitled to any resulting tax refunds relating to any period from and after the Closing Date and (ii) Seller shall be entitled to any
resulting tax refunds prior to the Closing Date after deducting therefrom Sellers pro rata share of attorneys fees and collection costs incurred in connection with obtaining such tax refunds, calculated on the basis of the number of days
during the period for which such refund was issued that Seller and Purchaser, respectively, owned the Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prorations pertaining to the true-up of operating expenses under the Leases shall be made by Purchaser and
Seller in accordance with schedules set forth in the Leases.   


 
7.6.11

7.10

ARTICLE 8 
DEFAULT   


8.1
 Purchaser Default. If Purchaser fails to close the transaction contemplated hereby when obligated to do so and such failure continues for one
(1) business 
  33 




 
 
day, or if Purchaser fails to perform any of its other obligations under this Agreement when obligated to do so, the Deposit shall be paid by Escrow Agent to Seller as fixed, agreed and
liquidated damages and as Sellers exclusive remedy for Purchasers failure to consummate Closing, and Seller and Purchaser shall be relieved from all liabilities and obligations under this Agreement (except for such liabilities and
obligations which expressly survive termination of, or closing on, this Agreement, as applicable). Seller and Purchaser agree that the forfeiture of the Deposit is not a penalty for Purchasers breach, but represents a fair and reasonable
estimate of the damages that would be incurred by the Seller as a result of Purchasers failure to consummate Closing, such damages being difficult or impossible to ascertain. 
 


8.2
Seller Default. If Seller fails to close the transaction contemplated hereby when obligated to do so, or if Seller fails to perform any of its other obligations
under this Agreement when obligated to do so, then Purchaser may elect one of the following as Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy: (i) terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination and the reasons therefor to Seller
in which event Seller shall be liable for any actual, documented, out-of-pocket due diligence costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with this transaction (provided, however, that Sellers liability under this subsection
(i) shall not exceed One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($125,000)), and thereupon neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any further obligations or liabilities one to the other except as otherwise provided herein, and the documents and
information provided to Purchaser by Seller and/or Sellers agents shall be returned to Seller and the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser; or (ii) only if the Sellers failure to perform consists of a failure to convey the
Property to Purchaser when required to do so under the provisions of this Agreement, hereby waiving all other actions, rights or claims for damages, bring an equitable action for specific performance. 
 


8.3
Delivery of Documents and Information. If either party terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Article 8, Purchaser shall return to Seller any
documents, reports or other information pertaining to the Property provided to or produced by or on behalf of Purchaser in connection with this Agreement no later than ten (10) days after the date of such termination. Purchasers
obligations under the preceding sentence shall survive any termination of this Agreement.   


8.4
Limitation of Liability; Survival   


 
8.4.1
 Except for those provisions which expressly survive termination of, or closing on, this Agreement, as applicable, (i) none of the provisions of
this Agreement shall survive delivery of the Deed and (ii) all of the provisions of this Agreement shall be merged therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2 of this Agreement shall survive settlement and delivery of the Deed for a period of nine (9) months from the Closing Date and shall not be merged therein; provided,

  34 




 
 
however, that in the event of a breach by Seller of a representation or warranty under Section 6.1 of this Agreement, Sellers liability for such breach shall survive only for
claims asserted by Purchaser against Seller and received in writing by Seller from Purchaser prior to the expiration of nine (9) months from the Closing Date, and after such nine (9) month period said representations and warranties shall
be extinguished and of no further force and effect with respect to any claims not asserted by Purchaser prior to the expiration of such period. Further, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein or in any Closing Document, if Purchaser,
with actual knowledge of (a) a default in any of the covenants, agreements or obligations to be performed by Seller under this Agreement and/or (b) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Seller made in this
Agreement nonetheless elects to proceed to Closing, then, upon the consummation of the Closing, Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any such default and/or breach or inaccuracy and shall have no claim against Seller with respect thereto.
  


 
8.4.2
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein or in any document or instrument executed by Seller and delivered to Purchaser at or in connection with the
closing, including, but not limited to, the Deed (collectively, Closing Documents), Seller shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to any suits, actions, proceedings, investigations, demands, claims, liabilities, fines,
penalties, liens, judgments, losses, injuries, damages, expenses or costs, including, without limitation, attorneys and experts fees and costs and investigation and remediation costs under any of the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or in any Closing Document (collectively, Claims), except to the extent (and only to the extent) that the aggregate amount of all Claims for breach of Sellers representations and warranties
exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the Threshold Amount) and, in such case Seller shall be liable for all Claims up to and exceeding the Threshold Amount; provided, however, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
herein or in any Closing Document, the total liability of Seller for any or all Claims with respect to the Property, this Agreement or any other Closing Document shall not exceed Three Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,500,000) (the
Cap Amount). Purchaser shall not make any Claim or deliver any Claim notice, unless in good faith, it believes would exceed the Threshold Amount as set forth above. The terms of this Section 8.4.2 shall survive Closing.
 ARTICLE 9  DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION AND CONDEMNATION  Seller shall notify Purchaser immediately of the
occurrence of any damage to or destruction of, or the initiation of any condemnation or similar proceedings with respect to a Material Portion (as defined below) of the Property occurring prior to the Closing. In such event, Purchaser may, at its
option within seven (7) days after receipt of such notice, elect to terminate this Agreement by giving Seller written notice thereof, in which 
  35 



event the parties hereto shall be relieved and released of and from any further duties, obligations, rights, or liabilities hereunder (except for such obligations and provisions which expressly
survive termination of this Agreement) and the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser; provided that Purchaser had not caused the damage to or destruction of the Property. If the scheduled Closing Date falls within the aforesaid seven (7) day
period, then the Closing shall be extended to the next business day following the end of said seven (7) day period. If (i) Seller does not receive Purchasers termination notice within such timeframe or Purchaser otherwise elects to
consummate the purchase contemplated under this Agreement; or (ii) less than a Material Portion of the Property is destroyed or subject to taking, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the purchase contemplated herein, less
any portion of the Property taken by eminent domain or condemnation, shall be consummated with no further adjustment or modification except that the Purchase Price shall be reduced to reflect (i) any deductible in insurance proceeds and, in
which event, at or before the Closing, Seller shall pay to Purchaser all insurance proceeds received by Seller (less reasonable expenses incurred by Seller, including attorneys fees) and transfer to Purchaser all additional insurance proceeds (less
reasonable expenses incurred by Seller, including attorneys fees) resulting from any casualty or (ii) any awards that have been or may thereafter be made for any taking or condemnation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have no
liability to Purchaser for uninsured or underinsured losses, or any other damages whatsoever. For purposes of this Article 9, a Material Portion of the Property shall mean (x) with respect to a casualty, damage for
which the cost of repair is in excess of Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00); or (y) with respect to the initiation of any condemnation or similar proceedings (a Condemnation), a taking of any portion of the
Property as would either prevent Purchaser from using and operating the Property as an office building; or (z) with respect to a casualty or Condemnation, the damage or taking would provide Raytheon with a right to terminate the Raytheon Lease.
 ARTICLE 10  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS   


10.1
 Right of First Offer under the Raytheon Lease. Pursuant to the Raytheon Lease, in the event Seller elects to sell or market the Property for
sale, Raytheon has an option to purchase the Property (the Right of First Offer). In connection with the Right of First Offer, Seller is obligated to notify Raytheon in writing of the price at which Seller intends to market the Property,
together with the other material terms and conditions of such listing. If Raytheon desires to purchase the Property in accordance with the terms set forth in such notice from Seller, Raytheon is required to provide Seller with written notice thereof
within thirty (30) days thereafter. Seller notified Raytheon in writing on August 18, 2010 of the price at which Seller intends to market the Property, together with the other material terms and conditions of such listing. Thirty
(30) days thereafter, on September 17, 2010, Seller received an e-mail from Raytheon stating that Raytheon would not be taking advantage of the Right of First Offer at this time; provided, however, Purchaser acknowledges that, pursuant to
the Raytheon Lease, if (a) the Closing under 
  36 




 
 
this Agreement does not occur within twelve (12) months after August 18, 2010 (the date Seller notified Raytheon in writing of the price at which Seller intends to market the Property,
together with the other material terms and conditions of such listing), or (b) the purchase price and other economic terms of the transfer to Purchaser are less than ninety percent (90%) of the economic terms contained in such written
notice to Raytheon, Raytheon again shall have the Right of First Offer under the terms more specifically described in the Raytheon Lease. Consequently, the Sellers obligations hereunder (and the Purchasers rights to purchase the Property
hereunder) are subject to the rights of Raytheon and, in connection therewith, if Raytheon elects to purchase the Property pursuant to the foregoing, Seller shall terminate this Agreement by giving Purchaser written notice thereof, in which event
the parties hereto shall be relieved and released of and from any further duties, obligations, rights, or liabilities hereunder (except for such obligations and provisions which expressly survive termination of this Agreement), the Deposit shall be
returned to Purchaser and Seller shall be liable for any actual, documented, out-of-pocket due diligence costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with this transaction (provided, however, that Sellers liability under this
Section 10.1 shall not exceed Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000)).   


10.2
Broker. Each party to this Agreement represents and warrants to the other that no person or entity, other than CB Richard Ellis (Sellers
Broker), can properly claim a right to a real estate commission, real estate finders fee, real estate acquisition fee or other real estate brokerage type compensation (collectively, Real Estate Compensation) based
upon the acts of that party with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and each party hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and protect the other against and to hold the other harmless from any loss, cost or expense (including but
not limited to attorneys fees and returned commissions) resulting from any claim for Real Estate Compensation by any person or entity based upon such acts. Seller shall pay the Real Estate Compensation to Sellers Broker per the terms of
a separate agreement between Seller and Sellers Broker. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this agreement, the representations, warranties and indemnities set forth in this Section 10.2 shall survive the Closing.
  


10.3
Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and: (i) sent by Federal Express or similar nationally
recognized overnight courier service designating early morning delivery (any notice so delivered shall be deemed to have been received on the next business day following receipt by the courier); or, (ii) transmitted by facsimile (any notice so
delivered shall be deemed to have been received upon the date reflected by the senders facsimile confirmation receipt) with a hard copy sent within one (1) business day by Federal Express or similar nationally recognized overnight courier
service, at the address specified below:

Section 10.3 change the person or persons and/or address or addresses, or designate an additional person or persons or an additional address or addresses, for its notices, but notice of a change of address shall only be effective upon
receipt. Seller and Purchaser each agree that it will not refuse or reject delivery of any notice given hereunder, that it will acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the same upon request by the other party and that any notice rejected

  38 



or refused by it shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have been received by the rejecting party on the date so refused or rejected, as conclusively established by the records of
the U.S. Postal Service or the courier service.  All notices that are required or permitted to be given under this Agreement may be given by
the parties hereto or by their respective counsel, who are hereby authorized to do so on the parties behalf.   


10.4
Entire Agreement; No Modifications. This Agreement, together with the schedules and exhibits attached hereto, incorporates all agreements, warranties,
representations and understandings between the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire agreement of Seller and Purchaser with respect to the purchase and sale of the Property. Any prior or
contemporaneous correspondence, memoranda, understandings, offers, negotiations and agreements, oral or written, are merged herein and replaced in total by this Agreement and the exhibits hereto and shall be of no further force or effect. This
Agreement may not be modified or amended except in a writing signed by Seller and Purchaser.   


10.5
Time. Time is of the essence in the performance of the parties obligations set forth in this Agreement. However, if the final date of any period which is
set out in any provision of this Agreement or the Closing Date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday under the laws of the United States, then the time of such period or the Closing Date, as the case may be, shall be extended to the next date
which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.   


10.6
Attorneys Fees. In the event any action or proceeding at law or in equity between Purchaser and Seller to enforce or interpret any provision of this
Agreement or to protect or establish any right or remedy of either Purchaser or Seller hereunder, the unsuccessful party to such action or proceeding shall pay to the prevailing party all costs and expenses including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys and paralegals fees and expenses, incurred by such prevailing party, in such action or proceeding and in any appeal in connection therewith, whether or not such action, proceeding or appeal is prosecuted to judgment or other
final determination, together with all costs of enforcement and/or collection of any judgment or other relief.   


10.7
No Deductions or Off-Sets. Purchaser acknowledges that the Purchase Price to be paid for the Property pursuant to this Agreement is a net amount and shall not be
subject to any off-sets or deductions except as provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of the Purchase Price shall be subject to the prorations and adjustments provided for in Article 7 above
  


10.8
 Successors, Assigns and Designees. Purchaser may not assign any of Purchasers rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent
of Seller, which may be granted or withheld in Sellers sole discretion; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the right to assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate of Purchaser or CBRE Operating Partnership, L.P. (i.e. a
company controlling, under 
  39 




 
 
common control with, or controlled by, Purchaser) without the consent of Seller. Provided further, Purchaser shall have the right, upon written notice to Seller delivered no less than five
(5) days prior to Closing, to designate one or more affiliates of Purchaser to receive the conveyance of one or more of the parcels comprising the Property, together with such other instruments (i.e., Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption of
Leases, Assignment and Assumption of Contracts, etc.) necessary to effectuate the conveyance of such designated parcel(s) as contemplated herein. No assignment or designation by Purchaser will relieve Purchaser of its obligations under this
Agreement. In connection with any such assignment or designation, Purchaser shall require the assignee or designee to be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to expressly assume in writing for the benefit of Seller all of
the obligations of Purchaser hereunder (e.g., in the case of a designation, all of the obligations of Purchaser hereunder pertaining to such designated parcel(s)), including the obligation to enter into the documents required under
Section 1.3 (Pedestrian Overpass) and Section 1.6 (CC7/CC8/Bonds Pertaining to the Property), from and after the date of such assignment or designation. Subject to the limitations on assignment expressed in this
Section 10.8, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, Purchaser and Seller and their respective successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.   


10.9
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, and delivered by means of
facsimile transmission, .pdf or otherwise, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 
 


10.10
Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
  


10.11
Construction. The parties acknowledge that each party and its counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that no rule of construction to the effect
that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any exhibits to it or any document executed and delivered by either party in connection with this Agreement. All captions
in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not be used in the interpretation of this Agreement or any related document.   


10.12
Partial Invalidity. If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall, to any extent, be invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement or the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each term and provision of
this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
  40 


 


10.13
Confidentiality.   


 
10.13.1
The parties entered into that certain AOL Inc. Confidential Non-disclosure Agreement dated August 2, 2010 (the Confidentiality Agreement). Upon the
Effective Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be of no further effect and the terms of this Section 10.13 shall govern the parties rights and obligations with respect to Confidential Information as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement. If for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall, at Sellers option, destroy or deliver to Seller, within five (5) business days after termination of this Agreement, at no
expense to Seller, all of Sellers Materials delivered or made available by Seller to Purchaser, along with any information, reports, statements, and other documents previously delivered to Purchaser by Seller. Nothing, however, contained
herein shall obligate Purchaser or the parties in Section 10.13.2(ii), as the case may be, to return or destroy Confidential Information contained on their backup information technology systems and the Purchaser and such parties may retain
copies of any Confidential Information subject to the confidentiality terms herein, in accordance with Purchaser or such parties record retention practices for legal or regulatory purposes. 
   


 
10.13.2
 Unless and until the parties consummate Closing of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser shall not disclose, publish or
communicate, either directly or indirectly, any of the information contained in the Confidential Documents (as defined in this Section 10.13.2), nor any other information obtained by or on behalf of Purchaser regarding the Property,
except (i) subject to the procedures set forth in Section 10.13.3 with respect to Required Disclosures, in response to any law or lawful process requiring disclosure of the same, or (ii) to prospective sources of financing and
to mortgage brokers, consultants, experts, attorneys, accountants, and professionals engaged by Purchaser or Seller in connection with this transaction, provided that Purchaser informs such parties of the confidential nature of such information and
such parties agree not to disclose such information except as permitted under this Agreement, Purchaser being liable for such parties failure to maintain confidentiality as if Purchaser had breached the requirements of this
Section 10.13. Confidential Documents shall mean all of Sellers Materials delivered or made available by Seller to Purchaser, along with any information, reports, statements, and other documents previously delivered to
Purchaser by Seller, and all other documents which are the work product of Purchaser and/or Purchasers Representatives relating to the Property, including, without limitation, any due diligence materials produced by third parties for Purchaser
in connection with the Property. Purchaser and Seller agree that each shall, at all times prior to the Closing, keep the terms and conditions of this Agreement confidential (subject to the exceptions stated in the preceding sentence).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may (i) use or disclose information known or available generally to the public (other than such information known or available generally to the public as a result of a violation of this Agreement by
Purchaser) or (ii)
  41 




 
 
subject to the procedure set forth in Section 10.13.3 with respect to Required Disclosures, disclose information in order to comply with any governmental order, statute, rule,
regulation, regulatory authority requirement or request, (iii) disclose information in order to enforce any rights or remedies of it under this Agreement or (iv) use information independently developed by any employee, agent or consultant
of Purchaser who did not have access to the Confidential Documents.   


 
10.13.3
The parties hereby covenant that (i) prior to the Closing, neither party shall issue any press release or public statement (a Release) with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, and (ii) after the Closing, any initial Release issued by either party shall be subject to the review and approval of the other party
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that the foregoing covenant shall not apply to any Releases, other than an initial Release, and any disclosure or public statement required by law, the
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any other applicable regulatory bodies or the applicable stock exchange (a Required Disclosure); provided further that, prior to Closing, if reasonably practicable in relation
to when the Required Disclosure is due, the disclosing party shall, two (2) business days prior to making a Required Disclosure, submit the Required Disclosure to the non-disclosing party for the non-disclosing partys reasonable review
and comment. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that the other partys agreement to maintain the confidentiality of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to not make any Release (other than a Required Disclosure) concerning this
transaction without the prior written consent of the other party is a material inducement to their entering into this Agreement, and the terms of this Section 10.13 shall survive Closing or the termination of this Agreement without
Closing.   


10.14
Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the party which is entitled to the benefit thereof. To be effective, each such
waiver shall be in writing, shall specifically refer to this Agreement and the term or condition being waived, and shall be executed by an authorized officer of such party. A waiver on one occasion shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the same or
any other breach on a future occasion.   


10.15
Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party to this Agreement waives any right to trial by jury in any action, matter or proceeding regarding this Agreement or any
provision hereof.   


10.16
Service of Process. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process in any action or proceeding by receipt of mailed copies thereof by national courier
to its address as specified in or pursuant to Section 10.3 hereof. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available method.

  42 


 


10.17
No Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) in no event will either party be liable for any
consequential, indirect, exemplary, special, or incidental damages arising from or in any way relating to this Agreement; and, (ii) in no event shall either party seek satisfaction for any obligation from any of the other partys partners,
shareholders, members, managers, officers, directors, trustees, beneficiaries, employees, agents, legal representatives, successors or assigns, nor shall any such person or entity have any personal liability for any such obligations of such party.
The provisions of this Section 10.17 shall survive termination of this Agreement or the Closing of the transaction contemplated hereby. The foregoing limitation on damages shall not apply with respect to either partys third-party
related indemnity obligations under Section 1.3, Section 1.6 , Section 1.7 and Section 4.2.10.   


10.18
Damages. Purchaser agrees that any liability of Seller under any claim brought prior to the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement or any document or instrument
delivered simultaneously or in connection with, or pursuant to this Agreement, shall be limited solely to the return of the Deposit and reimbursement set forth in Section 8.2. With respect to any such claim brought following the Closing
Date, any liability of Seller shall be limited to Sellers assets up to an amount equal to the Cap Amount. In no event shall Purchaser seek satisfaction for any obligation from any of Sellers members or from any members, shareholders,
officers, directors, trustees, beneficiaries, employees, agents, legal representatives, successors or assigns of such members, nor shall any such person or entity have any personal liability for any such obligations of Seller
  


10.19
Incorporation by Reference. All of the exhibits and schedules attached to this Agreement or referred to herein and all documents in the nature of such exhibits
and schedules, when executed, are by this reference incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement.   


10.20
DRAFTS NOT AN OFFER TO ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT. The parties hereto agree that the submission of a draft of this Agreement by one party to another
is not intended by either party to be an offer to enter into a legally binding contract with respect to the purchase and sale of the Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The parties shall be legally bound with respect to the purchase
and sale of the Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement only if and when the parties have been able to negotiate all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement in a manner acceptable to each of the parties in their respective sole
discretion, including, without limitation, all of the exhibits and schedules hereto, and each of Seller and Purchaser have fully executed and delivered to each other a counterpart of this Agreement, including, without limitation, all exhibits and
schedules hereto.  [SIGNATURE PAGE(S) FOLLOW]
