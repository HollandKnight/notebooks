1 


1.1.6 All of Sellers rights, if any, in all service contracts (other

agrees to sell to Buyer all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Property, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
1.3 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Property (the Purchase Price) shall be Twenty Million Four Hundred
Thousand and 00/100s Dollars ($20,400,000.00). The Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller by Buyer on the Closing Date (as defined below), by assumption of Sellers Loan (based on the principal balance of the Loan on the Closing Date), and the
remainder by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds, plus or minus all adjustments or credits as set forth herein. 
1.4 Deposit. Within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Date, Buyer shall deliver to Chicago Title Insurance
Corporation, 830 East Main Street, Suite 1600, Richmond, VA 23219, Attn: Chris Newman (Escrow Holder), a good faith deposit in the amount of Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) (the Initial Deposit), and within
three (3) Business Days following the receipt of the approval of Existing Lender (defined in Section 3.6) to the Loan Assumption (defined in Section 3.6), assuming Buyer has not previously terminated this Agreement, Buyer shall
deliver to Escrow Holder an additional good faith deposit (Additional Deposit) of Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($50,000.00). The Initial Deposit and the Additional Deposit shall be collectively referred to as the Deposit. For
purposes of this Agreement the terms Deposit shall include any and all interest earned thereon. The Deposit shall be held in an insured, interest-bearing account with interest accruing for the benefit of Buyer. The Deposit shall be
applied to the Purchase Price if the Closing occurs. After the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, the Deposit shall be nonrefundable to Buyer unless escrow fails to close due to (i) Sellers breach or default under this Agreement,
(ii) a failure of a representation or warranty by Seller to be true and correct as of the Closing, (iii) a failure of a condition precedent set forth in Section 5.4, (iv) a casualty or condemnation, (v) the failure of
Existing Lender (defined in Section 3.6) to approve the Loan Assumption (defined in Section 3.6), or (vi) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, and the Deposit shall constitute liquidated damages to Seller if escrow fails
to close solely as a result of Buyers default as provided in Section 6.1 below. In the event Buyer shall elect to terminate this Agreement under Section 3.5, or be deemed to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 2.2, the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer as provided in Section 3.5 below.   
2 


1.5 Closing Date. The Closing shall take place through an escrow opened with Escrow
Holder on or before the date (the Closing Date) which is sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (defined in Section 3.2 below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the approval of the Loan
Assumption (defined in Section 3.6) by Existing Lender (defined in Section 3.6), the Buyer has the right, upon five (5) Business Days notice to Seller, to accelerate the Closing Date. In addition to the foregoing, the Buyer and
Seller may elect to hold the Closing at such other place and on such other later date as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree in writing. For purposes of this Agreement Close of Escrow or Closing means the date Escrow Holder
disburses funds in accordance with this Agreement and is irrevocably committed to record the Deed in favor of Buyer.  1.6
Independent Consideration. As separate consideration for Seller entering into this Agreement, Buyer has delivered to Seller the sum of One Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($1,000.00) (the Independent Consideration), which
consideration shall be deemed earned as of the Effective Date.  ARTICLE 2 
TITLE AND SURVEY 
2.1 Title and Survey. During the Due Diligence Period (defined in Section 3.2 below), Buyer, at Buyers cost and
expense, may obtain a preliminary title report or commitment (the Preliminary Report) from Chicago Title Insurance Corporation, 830 East Main Street, Suite 1600, Richmond, Virginia 23219, Attn: Chris Newman (the Title
Company), together with legible copies of all recorded encumbrances and exceptions to title as well as an existing survey, if any, from Seller. Buyer shall, at its option and at its expense, (i) conduct UCC searches covering Seller and
the Property (the UCC Searches) and (ii) order an update of the existing survey of the Real Property by a licensed surveyor or registered professional engineer (the Survey). Buyer shall cause the Title Company to provide
to Seller and Sellers counsel a copy of the Preliminary Report, the UCC Searches, and the Survey.  2.2 Review of the
Preliminary Report, Survey and UCC Searches; Objection; Approval or Termination. On or before the last day of the Due Diligence Period, with respect to the Preliminary Report, or within ten (10) days after delivery to Buyer of any
supplement to the Preliminary Title Report (Supplemental Report), with respect only to matters not set forth in the Preliminary Report but set forth in the Supplemental Report, Buyer may deliver to Seller a notice (the Title
Objection Notice) setting forth (i) any matters shown on the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey or UCC Searches to which Buyer objects and requires to be eliminated, (ii) any modifications, supplements or other
modifications of the legal description, description of exceptions or other matters set forth in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report or Survey, and (iii) any endorsements or other affirmative title insurance coverage required to be
included in the Title Policy (collectively, clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) herein shall be referred to hereinafter as the Title Objections). Buyer may make its determination of whether any of the matters contained in the
Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey or UCC   
3 



Searches (as applicable) are appropriate or are objectionable in its sole discretion. Buyers failure to give the Title Objection Notice shall be deemed to constitute Buyers
disapproval of matters disclosed in the Preliminary Report, Supplemental Report, Survey, or UCC Searches (as applicable) and this Agreement shall terminate. If Buyer delivers a Title Objection Notice, Seller shall have five (5) Business Days
from the receipt of Buyers notice (the Sellers Response Period) to provide Buyer with written notice of Sellers election to remove or otherwise cure to Buyers satisfaction the Title Objections prior to the Closing
(Seller Response Notice); provided however, and notwithstanding Buyers inclusion or lack thereof in any Title Objection Notice, Seller shall be obligated to eliminate all monetary liens or encumbrances arising by through or under
Seller, and any exceptions created or consented to by Seller after the Effective Date (collectively, the Required Cure Items), unless approved in writing by Buyer, which Seller shall cause to be released at Closing. With the exception of
the Required Cure Items, if Seller fails to deliver the Seller Response Notice within the Seller Response Period, then Seller shall be deemed not to have elected to cure all of the disapproved matters set forth in Buyers Title Objection
Notice. If Seller timely delivers notice of election not to cure a disapproved item, or is deemed not to have elected to cure a disapproved item, then Buyer may either (i) elect to terminate this Agreement, or (ii) waive in writing its
prior disapproval of such item and accept title subject to such previously disapproved item by delivering notice of Buyers election to Seller within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of the Seller Response Notice (the Buyer
Response Period). If Buyer fails to deliver its notice of election to terminate this Agreement or waive its prior disapproval within the Buyer Response Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have disapproved of Sellers Response Notice and this
Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 2.2, the provisions of Section 3.5 shall apply. 
2.3 Required Title Condition. Title to the Property shall be conveyed to Buyer subject only to the following permitted
encumbrances: (a) current, non-delinquent real estate taxes and assessments, (b) the matters set forth in the Preliminary Report and permitted as part of the Required Title Condition, (c) the Lease, and (d) any other matters
approved in writing by Buyer.  ARTICLE 3 
INSPECTION AND DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD 
3.1 Access. From and after the Effective Date through the Closing, Buyer, personally or through its authorized agent or
representatives, shall be entitled, upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, to enter upon the Property during normal business hours and shall have the right to make such investigations, including tenant interviews (subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 3.1(h) hereof), appraisals, engineering studies, soil tests, environmental studies and underwriting analyses, as Buyer deems reasonably necessary or advisable. Buyer shall have the right to conduct a Phase I environmental site
assessment, and, if necessary, a Phase II environmental site assessment (including soils borings, soil sampling and, if relevant, ground water testing, and invasive sampling of building materials with respect to the Property). Buyers
activities at the Property shall be conducted in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the occupancy of the tenant or its employees, licensees or invitees. Regarding Buyers investigations, in addition to the forgoing:
 a. Prior to the physical entry upon the Property by Buyer or Buyers agents, contractors, or employees,
Buyer must deliver evidence to Seller that Buyer has insurance for its proposed inspection activities, in amounts and with coverages that are substantially the same as those maintained by Seller or in such lesser amounts or with such lesser
coverages as are reasonably satisfactory to Seller;   
4 


b. Buyer must notify Seller at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance
of Buyers plans to conduct tests so that Seller may be present during the tests;  c. if the Land or
Improvements are altered because of Buyers inspections, Buyer must return the Land or Improvements to their pre-inspection condition promptly after the alteration occurs; 
d. Buyer must deliver to Seller copies of all inspection reports that Buyer prepares or receives from third-party
consultants or contractors within three (3) days after their preparation or receipt;  e. Buyer must abide
by any other reasonable entry rules imposed by Seller;  f. Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold Seller
harmless from any loss, reasonable attorneys fees, expenses, or claims arising out of Buyers investigation of the Land or Improvements, except repair or remediation of existing conditions discovered by Buyers inspections. The
obligations of Buyer under this provision will survive termination of this Agreement and Closing; and  g.
Buyer releases Seller and those persons acting on Sellers behalf from all claims and causes of action (including claims for attorneys fees and court and other costs) resulting from Buyers investigation of the Land or Improvements.
 h. Buyer, or Buyers representatives may meet with a representative of the Tenant, or any governmental
entity with responsibility for the administration of the Lease, for the sole purpose of gathering information in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including information regarding the tenant and the Lease and any
property condition); provided, however, Buyer must contact Seller at least three (3) full Business Days in advance by telephone to inform Seller of Buyers intended meeting and to allow Seller the opportunity to attend such meeting in
person if Seller desires.  3.2 Due Diligence Period. Buyer shall have forty-five (45) days from the Effective Date
of this Agreement (the Due Diligence Period) to physically inspect the Property, review the economic data, underwrite the tenants and review the Leases, conduct appraisals, perform examinations of the physical condition of the
Improvements, examine the Property for the presence of Hazardous Materials (as defined below), and to otherwise conduct such due diligence review of the Property and all of the items to be furnished by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3

5 


3.3 Items to be Provided by Seller. No later than one (1) Business Day after the
Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (by electronic or overnight delivery) accurate and complete copies of all of the information set forth on Exhibit G attached hereto and incorporated herein (Property
Information). In addition to the foregoing deliveries, Seller shall make available to Buyer for inspection and copying at Sellers offices in Houston, Texas the originals of any of the Property Information and any and all other documents,
instruments, studies, reports, surveys, maps, files, correspondence (including without limitation, tenant correspondence files), reports and other materials related to the Property and not included in the Property Information. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, Seller shall not be obligated to make available to Buyer any information, materials or documents (whether in electronic or printed format) that consist of appraisals, budgets, strategic plans for the Property, internal analyses,
information relating to the marketing of the Property for sale, attorney and accountant work product, attorney-client privileged documents, internal correspondence of Seller, any direct or indirect owner of any beneficial interest in Seller, or any
of their respective affiliates, and correspondence by and among such parties, or other information in the possession or control of Seller, its property manager or any direct or indirect owner of any beneficial interest in Seller, that Seller, in its
sole discretion, deems to be confidential or proprietary to Seller, Sellers business or operation of Sellers business. Seller agrees to update, provide and make available to Buyer new Property Information as it becomes available. Except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Seller has not made and does not make any warranty or representation regarding the truth, accuracy or completeness of the Property Information or the source(s) thereof, and some if not all of the Property
Information was prepared by third parties other than Seller. Seller expressly disclaims any and all liability for representations or warranties, express or implied, statements of fact and other matters contained in such information, or for omissions
from the Property Information, or in any other written or oral communications transmitted or made available to Buyer. Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to have its auditor, BDO Seidman, LLP, or
another qualified auditor of Buyers choosing conduct an audit of the property financial statements and other information. Where financial statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals
(GAAP), to the extent Seller does not have such financial statements, Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation), at its sole cost and expense, to have its accountants prepare Sellers financial statements in accordance with GAAP.
Except as otherwise set forth herein, Buyer shall rely solely upon its own investigation with respect to the Property, including without limitation, the Propertys physical, environmental or economic condition, compliance or lack of compliance
with any ordinance, order, permit or regulation or any other attribute or matter relating thereto. Seller has not undertaken any independent investigation as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the Property Information and is providing the
Property Information solely as an accommodation to Buyer.  3.4 Buyers Possible Early Termination. Buyer shall
have the right to approve in Buyers sole and absolute discretion, the Property, the Property Information, the Property Contracts, the Preliminary Report, any Supplemental Report, the Survey, the UCC Searches, or any other matter whatsoever
regarding the Property and the Loan Assumption. On or before the last day of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall provide written notice (Approval Notice) to Seller and Escrow Holder that Buyer has approved the Property, including the
assumption of the   
6 



Property Contracts. Buyers failure to provide an Approval Notice upon the expiration of the Due Diligence Period shall be deemed disapproval of the Property. At any time prior to the
expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer may provide written notice to Seller and Escrow Holder disapproving the Property (Disapproval Notice). Upon the giving of a Disapproval Notice or the deemed disapproval of the Property, this
Agreement shall automatically terminate and the provisions of Section 3.5 shall apply.  3.5 Consequences of
Buyers Early Termination. Upon the giving of a Disapproval Notice or upon deemed disapproval pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 3.5, this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and the parties shall be released from all further
obligations under this Agreement (except with respect to any provisions that by their terms survive a termination of this Agreement); provided, however, that if Seller is in default hereunder at the time of such termination, Section 6.2 shall
additionally apply. Provided Buyer is not then in default under the terms of this Agreement, Escrow Holder shall pay the entire Deposit to Buyer not later than one (1) Business Day following receipt of Buyers Disapproval Notice (as long
as the then-current investment of the Deposit can be liquidated in one (1) Business Day). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any event, Escrow Holder will obtain the written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, of both Seller and Buyer before releasing the Deposit to either party.  3.6 Assumption of Existing Loan. At
Closing, Buyer intends to assume the loan (the Loan Assumption) evidenced by a note in the original principal amount of Seventeen Million Twenty-Four Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($17,024,000.00) (the Loan). Documents securing
the Loan currently encumber the Property. The Loan was originally made by Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, N.A. as Trustee and is currently serviced by Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, N.A. (collectively with any successors and assigns, the Existing
Lender), and is evidenced and/or secured by a number of documents, which are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Loan Documents are listed on Exhibit H attached hereto and incorporated by reference. The
Existing Lenders consent and approval is required before Buyer will be permitted to assume the Loan. Buyer shall pay all costs, fees and expenses in connection with Buyer attempting to obtain Existing Lenders approval of the assumption
of the Loan, including but not limited to: (i) the Existing Lenders assumption fee in the amount of one percent (1.0%) of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan; (ii) legal fees and expenses of the special counsel
representing the beneficial holder of the promissory note described in the Loan Documents; (iii) document filing fees and title insurance endorsement fees required by Existing Lender; and (iv) legal fees for opinions of counsel required by
Existing Lender (collectively, the Loan Assumption Related Fees). In addition to the foregoing, Buyer shall not be responsible for and Seller shall be solely responsible for the costs of curing any defaults by Seller under the Loan and
all other costs and expenses incurred by Seller under the Loan whether or not related to the Loan Assumption. In connection with such approval, the parties shall diligently, promptly and in good faith attempt to obtain such approval and both parties
will supply the information reasonably requested by Existing Lender with respect to such approval. Buyer agrees to make application to the Lender for the Loan Assumption within ten (10) business days from Buyers receipt of all Property
Information, and Seller hereby authorizes Buyer to contact Existing Lender directly regarding the Loan Assumption. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in all respects in connection with the Loan Assumption, and Seller shall execute any and all
applications or other documents required   
7 



by Existing Lender as part of the Loan Assumption process. The documents evidencing the Loan Assumption shall provide that from and after the Closing Date Seller is to be released by Existing
Lender of all liability under the Loan Documents, and further such documents shall contain mutual indemnities between Buyer and Seller for costs, obligations and liabilities arising under the Loan Documents after and before the Closing Date,
respectively. It shall be a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to close that the terms of the Loan Assumption be acceptable to Buyer in Buyers sole and absolute discretion. This Agreement shall automatically terminate and the
Deposit shall be returned immediately to Buyer if approval of Buyers assumption of the Loan is denied or is not obtained prior to Closing. 
ARTICLE 4

5.8.2 Prorations. The following shall be prorated, credited, debited
and adjusted between Seller and Buyer as of 12:01 a.m. on the day of the Closing (except as otherwise provided) in accordance with this section. For purposes of calculating prorations, Buyer shall be deemed to be in title to the Property, and
therefore entitled to the income and responsible for the expenses, for the entire day upon which the Closing occurs.

any period after the Closing Date, Seller shall remit to Buyer that portion of the Unpaid Rents so received by Seller to which Buyer is entitled within ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller
specifically agrees not to undertake any effort to collect unpaid rent or other sums (however denominated) owed to Seller from any person if such person or any affiliate of such person is in possession of any space in the Property at the time of any
such collection effort.  (d) Property Taxes. Ad valorem taxes for the year in which the Closing occurs

(1) year.  (h) Leasing Commissions. On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall pay in full all
leasing commissions due to leasing or other agents for the current remaining term of the Lease (determined without regard to any unexercised termination or cancellation right). 
(i) Insurance Policies. Insurance premiums as to the policies, if any, that will continue after Closing.

Buyer by Seller at the Closing, subject only to the rights of the tenant under the Lease, rights arising under any Property Contracts not terminated by Buyer pursuant this Agreement, and rights arising under the matters set forth in the Preliminary
Report and permitted as part of the Required Title Condition. Seller and Buyer covenant and agree to execute at Closing a written notice of the acquisition of the Property by Buyer, for transmittal to the tenant. Such notice shall be prepared by
Buyer, at Buyers cost and expense, and approved by Seller, shall notify the tenant of the sale and transfer and shall contain appropriate instructions relating to the payment of future rentals, the giving of future notices and other matters
reasonably required by Buyer or required by law. Unless a different procedure is required by applicable law, in which event such laws shall be controlling, Buyer agrees to transmit or otherwise deliver such letters to the tenant promptly after the
Closing.  ARTICLE 6 
TERMINATION AND DEFAULT 
6.1 Buyer Default. If the sale contemplated hereby is not consummated because of a default by Buyer in its obligation to purchase
the Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement after Seller has performed or tendered performance of all of its material obligations in accordance with this Agreement, then: (a) this Agreement shall terminate; (b) the Deposit
shall be paid to and retained by Seller ; (c) Buyer will reimburse Seller for Sellers actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred to perform its obligations under this Agreement (including, but not limited to, recovery of all costs and
expenses and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by Seller after the Effective Date); and (d) Seller and Buyer shall have no further obligations to each other except those which survive the termination of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller
acknowledge that the damages to Seller in the event of a breach of this Agreement by Buyer would be difficult or impossible to determine, that the amount of the deposit plus interest represents the parties best and most accurate estimate of
the damages that would be suffered by Seller if the transaction should fail to close and that such estimate is reasonable under the circumstances existing as of the date of this Agreement and under the circumstances that Seller and Buyer reasonably
anticipate would exist at the time of such breach. Buyer and Seller agree that Sellers right to retain the Deposit together with any interest and earnings earned thereon shall be Sellers sole remedy, at law and in equity, for
Buyers failure to purchase the Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Seller hereby waives any right to an action for specific performance of any provisions of this Agreement. 
6.2 Sellers Default. If prior to Closing Seller fails to perform any of its obligations or is otherwise in default
hereunder, Buyer shall have the right to exercise any or all of the following remedies:  6.2.1 Waive such
failure and proceed to the Closing with no reduction in the Purchase Price; provided, however, that this provision will not limit Buyers right to receive reimbursement for attorneys fees pursuant to Section 9.8 below in connection
with any legal proceedings instituted by either party or Escrow Holder with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement, nor waive or affect Sellers indemnity obligations under this Agreement or Buyers rights to enforce those indemnity
obligations, nor waive or affect any of Sellers other obligations under this Agreement to be performed after the Closing or Buyers rights to enforce those obligations. 
 
25 


6.2.2 Terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller and Escrow Holder to that
effect, to recover the full amount of the Deposit and all earnings thereon, and to recover all of Buyers actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred to investigate the Land and Improvements after the Effective Date, including, but not limited to,
recovery of all costs and expenses and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by Buyer after the Effective Date.  ARTICLE
7  CASUALTY DAMAGE OR CONDEMNATION 
7.1 Casualty. If the Improvements are damaged by casualty prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have the sole option to elect either
to:  (a) acquire the Property as is (without reduction in the Purchase Price), plus an assignment without
recourse or credit of any insurance proceeds payable by virtue of such loss or damage plus a credit for any deductible or uninsured loss under said policy; or 
(b) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit. 
Such right must be exercised within forty five (45) days from the date Seller provides Buyer with notice of the loss
of the event giving rise to such right. If Buyer fails to provide notice of an election, then Buyer shall have been deemed to elect (b) above. 
7.2 Condemnation. In the event that any portion of the Property should be condemned prior to the Closing, at Buyers sole
option, elect either to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Deposit; or 
(b) close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 
In all other cases, or if Buyer elects to proceed under Section 7.2(b), Buyer shall purchase the Property in accordance with the
terms hereof (without reduction in the Purchase Price) and Seller shall assign to Buyer at Closing all condemnation proceeds payable as a result of such condemnation. Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to proceed under
Section 7.2(a) unless, within forty five (45) days from written notice of the condemnation, Buyer provides Seller with written notice that Buyer elects to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.2(b).  ARTICLE 8 
REAL ESTATE COMMISSION 
Buyer and Seller each represent to the other that no brokers or real estate commissions or other fees are or shall be due in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, except a commission payable to Marcus & Millichap, 9255 Towne Center Drive, Suite 700, San 
 
26 



Diego, California, 92121, Attn: Travis Trautvetter, under a separate agreement between such broker and Seller, which will be paid by Seller. Except as set forth in the previous sentence, each
party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other from and against any and all claims, demands or the cost or expense thereof, including reasonable attorneys fees, arising out of any brokers commission, fee or other compensation due

attorneys fees and expenses, whether at the investigative, pretrial, trial or appellate level. The prevailing party shall be determined by the court based upon an assessment of which partys major arguments or position prevailed.
 9.9 IRS Real Estate Sales Reporting. Buyer and Seller agree that Escrow Agent shall act as the person
responsible for closing the transaction which is the subject of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6045(e) of the Code and shall prepare and file all informational returns, including without limitation, IRS Form 1099-S, and shall
otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 6045(e) of the Code.  9.10 Time Periods. If the time for

descriptive headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any provisions of this Agreement. Words such as herein,

singular shall include the plural and the masculine sender shall include the feminine and neuter, and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The word including shall not be restrictive and shall be interpreted as if followed
by the words without limitation.  9.14 Business Day. As used herein, the term Business Day
means any day other than Saturday, Sunday and any day which is a legal holiday in the State of Texas.  9.15 Construction of

29 


9.16 Severability. The parties hereto intend and believe that each provision in this
Agreement comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions. However, if any provision in this Agreement is found by a court of law to be in violation of any applicable local, state or federal law, statute, ordinance,
administrative or judicial decision, or public policy, or if in any other respect such a court declares any such provision to be illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written, then it is the intent of all parties hereto that,
consistent with and with a view towards preserving the economic and legal arrangements among the parties hereto as expressed in this Agreement, such provision shall be given force and effect to the fullest possible extent, and that the remainder of
this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable provision were not contained herein, and that the rights, obligations and interests of the parties under the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect.  9.17 Exclusivity. After the Effective Date, Seller and its respective agents, representatives
and employees will abate all marketing efforts for the Land and Improvements. Any existing signs may remain. Any ordered advertising will be canceled, if cancelable without penalty; otherwise ordered advertising may proceed, but no additional
advertising will occur. Brokers and prospective buyers will not be shown the Land and Improvements and will be given only currently available printed information about the Land and Improvements prepared by Sellers broker. 
9.18 Section 1031 Exchange. Either party may consummate the purchase or sale of the Property as part of a so-called like kind
exchange (an Exchange) pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code, provided that (i) the Closing shall not be delayed or affected by reason of an Exchange nor shall the consummation or accomplishment of any Exchange be a condition
precedent or condition subsequent to a partys obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any party desiring an Exchange shall effect its Exchange through an assignment of this Agreement, or its rights under this Agreement, to a qualified
intermediary and the other party shall not be required to take an assignment of the purchase agreement for the relinquished or replacement property or be required to acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes of consummating such
Exchange; and (iii) the party desiring an Exchange shall pay any additional costs that would not otherwise have been incurred by Buyer or Seller had such party not consummated its purchase or sale through an Exchange. Neither party shall by
this agreement or acquiescence to an Exchange desired by the other party (1) have its rights under this Agreement affected or diminished in any manner or (2) be responsible for compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to the other
party that such partys Exchange in fact complies with Section 1031 of the Code. In connection with such cooperation, Seller agrees, upon request of Buyer to direct deed for actual interests in the property to designees of
Buyer.  9.19 Statutory Notices. 
(a) Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. If the property that is the subject of this Agreement is located outside the
limits of a municipality, the property may now or later be included in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality and may now or later be subject to annexation by the municipality. Each municipality maintains a map that depicts its
boundaries and extraterritorial jurisdiction. To determine if the property is located within a municipalitys extraterritorial jurisdiction or is likely to be located within a municipalitys extraterritorial jurisdiction, contact all
municipalities located in the general proximity of the property for further information.   
30 


(b) Notice Regarding Possible Liability for Additional Taxes. If for
the current ad valorem tax year the taxable value of the land that is the subject of this contract is determined by a special appraisal method that allows for appraisal of the land at less than its market value, the person to whom the land is
transferred may not be allowed to qualify the land for that special appraisal in a subsequent tax year and the land may then be appraised at its full market value. In addition, the transfer of the land or a subsequent change in the use of the land
may result in the imposition of an additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer or the change in the use of the land. The taxable value of the land and the applicable method of appraisal for the current tax year is public information
and may be obtained from the tax appraisal district established for the county in which the land is located. 
(c) Pipeline Notice. As of the date of this Agreement, Seller is not aware of the existence or location of a
transportation pipeline, including a pipeline for the transportation of natural gas, natural gas liquids, synthetic gas, liquefied petroleum gas, petroleum or a petroleum product, or a hazardous substance, under the Property. 
(d) Disclosure. The Texas Real Estate License Act requires written notice to Purchaser that it should have
an attorney examine an abstract of title to the Property or else obtain a policy of title insurance. Notice to such effect is therefore hereby given to Purchaser. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.
