(o)
Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any fact or circumstance which becomes actually known to Seller between the date of execution of this Agreement and the date for close of escrow, and which knowledge renders untrue any representation made in this Agreement.

4.2
Buyers Representations and Warranties.  In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants of Buyer contained in other section of this Agreement, Buyer hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Seller as follows:  

(a)
Buyer has the legal and financial capacity and full power and authority to enter into and carry out the agreements contained in, and the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement;

(b)
This Agreement has been duly authorized and executed by Buyer and, upon delivery to and execution by Seller shall be a valid and binding Agreement of Buyer;

(c)
Subject to reliance on Sellers representations and warranties, Buyer, in purchasing the Property, shall do so on the basis of its own investigation of the Property including, without limitation, the physical, environmental, economic, and legal condition and all other aspects of the Property and, other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Buyer is not relying upon any representations or warranties made by Seller or anyone acting or claiming to act on Sellers behalf concerning the Property;

(d)
Buyer assumes the risk that any adverse matter may not have been revealed in this Agreement or by its investigation provided, however, Buyer does not waive any claim against Seller for willful concealment of information concerning the Property that would be materially adverse to Buyers decision to consummate the purchase thereof;

(e)
Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of any fact or circumstance which becomes actually known to Buyer between the Effective Date of this Agreement and the date for close of escrow, and which knowledge renders untrue any representation made in this Agreement.

4.3  
Survival of Representations and Warranties.  The representations and 
warranties set forth in this Agreement are made as of the Effective Date and are remade as of the Closing Date (as described in the Bring-down Certificate) and shall not be deemed to be merged into or waived by the instruments of Closing, but shall survive the Closing for a period of one (1) year.  Seller and Buyer shall have the right to bring an action thereon only if Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, has given the other party written notice of the circumstances giving rise to the alleged breach within thirty (30) days of discovery of such claim and prior to the end of the one (1) year period.  Each party agrees to defend and indemnify the other against any claim, liability, damage or expense asserted against or suffered by such other party arising out of the breach or inaccuracy of any such representation or warranty.  If, after the Effective Date and prior to the Closing, Seller gives Buyer written notice pursuan
t to Section 4.1(o) above, then Buyer shall have the right to elect to terminate this Agreement and the Escrow within five (5) business days following receipt of such notice from Seller (and if such fifth (5th) 


15


business day is after the date then scheduled for the Closing, the Closing shall be extended to the sixth (6th) business day following the receipt of such notice).  If Buyer timely exercises this right to terminate, the Deposit, and any interest earned thereon shall be promptly refunded to Buyer by Escrow Agent, less any Escrow cancellation charges which shall be paid by Buyer, and thereafter neither party shall have any further liability or obligation to the other.  Buyer shall thereafter promptly return to Seller all Due Diligence Materials that may have been provided by or obtained from Seller. 

4.4   Damage.  Risk of loss up to and including the Closing Date shall be borne by Seller.  In the event of any material damage to or destruction of the Property or any portion thereof, Buyer may, at its option, by notice to Seller given within 10 days after Seller notifies Buyer of such damage or destruction (and if necessary the Closing Date shall be extended to give Buyer the full 10-day period to make such election):  (i) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller and Escrow Agent and the Deposit plus accrued interest shall be immediately returned to Buyer, or (ii) proceed under this Agreement, receive any insurance proceeds (including any rent loss insurance applicable to any period on and after the Closing Date) due Seller as a result of such damage or destruction and assume responsibility for such repair, and Buyer shall receive a credit at Closing for any deductible, 
uninsured or coinsured amount under said insurance policies.  If Buyer elects (ii) above, Buyer may extend the Closing Date for up to an additional 10 day period in which to obtain insurance settlement agreements with Sellers insurers, and Seller will cooperate with Buyer in obtaining the insurance proceeds and such agreements from Sellers insurers.  If the Property is not materially damaged, then Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement, but Seller shall, at its cost, repair the damage before the Closing in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Buyer or if repairs cannot be completed before the Closing, credit Buyer at Closing for the reasonable cost to complete the repair.  "Material damage" and "Materially damaged" means damage (x) reasonably exceeding Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00), (y) that entitles Tenant to terminate the Lease, or (z) which, in Buyers reasonable estimation, will take longer than 90 days to repair.
 
5. INDEMNIFICATION.    

5.1
Sellers Indemnification of Buyer.   Seller shall indemnify, defend, protect 
and hold Buyer, its members, employees, managers, and agents harmless for, from and 
against any and all causes of action, claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and 
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, arising out of or related 
to any and all matters first occurring or liabilities first arising or accruing before the Close of Escrow with respect to the Property, except for such matters as may have been caused by the act or omission of Buyer.       

5.2
Buyers Indemnification of Seller.   Buyer shall indemnify, defend,
protect and hold Seller, its members, employees, managers, and agents harmless for, from and against any and all causes of action, claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, arising out of or related to any and all matters first occurring or liabilities first arising or accruing after the Close of Escrow with respect to the Property, except for such matters as may have been caused by the act or omission of Seller.

6.
CONDEMNATION.

If, prior to the Close of Escrow, any Material Portion of the Property is taken (or threatened to be taken) (the Taking) by any entity by condemnation or with the power of eminent domain such that (collectively, a Material Portion): (i) the Taking interferes with Buyers ownership and Tenants use of the Property or (ii) the Taking causes access to the Property to be reduced or restricted in any way, or (iii) allows the Tenant to terminate the Lease, Seller shall immediately notify Buyer in writing of such fact (the Taking Notice).  In such event, Buyer shall have the right, in the exercise of Buyers absolute and sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement and the Escrow upon written notice given to Seller and Escrow Agent not later than seven (7) days after the receipt by Buyer of the Taking Notice (and, if necessary, the Closing Date shall be extended to giv
e Buyer the full seven (7) day period to make such election).  If this Agreement and the Escrow are so terminated, all documents and funds, including the Deposit plus interest then held in Escrow, shall be promptly returned by Escrow Agent to each party who so deposited the same and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder, except for payment of Escrow cancellation fees which shall be paid by Buyer.  Buyer shall thereafter promptly return to Seller all Due Diligence Materials that may have been provided by or obtained from Seller. Alternatively, Buyer may proceed to consummate the transaction provided for herein at Buyers sole election, in which event Seller shall assign and turn over, and Buyer shall be entitled to receive and keep, any and all awards made or to be made in connection with the Taking, and the parties shall proceed to the Close of Escrow pursuant to the terms hereof, without any reduction in the Purchase Price.

7.       BROKERS.  

Seller is represented in this transaction by Retail West of which John Dubois is the Principal and Willis Ventures (collectively, the Broker) who exclusively represents the Seller.  Upon Close of Escrow Seller shall pay a real estate sales commission to Broker per its separate agreement with the Broker.  Seller shall have no obligation to pay any real estate sales commission to any broker or other party representing the Buyer.  The said commission payable to Broker shall only be due and payable upon Close of Escrow, and Seller shall have no obligation to pay any commission if Escrow does not close and Seller does not receive the Purchase Price in cash less commissions and closing costs as defined herein.   Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless against any loss, liability, damage, cost, claim or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by r
eason of any brokerage fee, commission or finders fee which is payable or alleged to be payable to any broker or finder by or on the basis of any alleged acts of Buyer.  Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer harmless against any loss, liability, damage, cost, claim or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by reason of any brokerage fee, commission or finders fee which is payable or alleged to be payable to Broker and any other broker or finder by or on the basis of any alleged acts by Seller.   

8.       ASSIGNMENT OF CERTAIN RIGHTS.    

Seller hereby assigns to Buyer as of the Close of Escrow all claims, counterclaims, defenses or actions, whether at common law, or pursuant to any other applicable federal or state or other laws which Seller may have, if any, against any third 


17


parties relating to the existence of any Hazardous Substance in, at, on, under or about the Real Property.   For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Hazardous Substance" shall mean any substance defined as hazardous material in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq., or at California Health & Safety Code Section 25316 or at Section 25281; as hazardous waste in the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 690, et seq., or at California Health & Safety Code Section 25117; as hazardous material in the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C. Section 1801, et seq.; or the regulations adopted or publications promulgated pursuant to such laws and any substance, material wa
ste, pollutant or contaminant listed or defined as hazardous or toxic under any Environmental Law.

9.
SELLER'S RIGHT TO BUYER'S DOCUMENTS.

If Buyer does not purchase the Property for any reason other than a default or breach hereunder by Seller, Buyer shall assign to Seller all studies, documents, engineering and other work performed by third parties with respect to the Property (collectively, the "Work Product"), subject to the proprietary rights of Buyer, and any proprietary rights of any engineer or other consultant preparing the same and any limitations on use imposed by them.   Seller acknowledges that Buyer shall make no warranties or representations regarding the adequacy of any Work Product, that Buyer expressly disclaims any liability for any and all defects or deficiencies contained in the Work Product.  Seller further agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its agents, employees, and contractors from any and all suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses, expenses or costs of any nature, including, bu
t not limited to actual attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of any use of the Work Product by or on behalf of Seller or any of its successors, assigns, licensees, agents or employees.   Sellers indemnity hereunder shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

18


INTEREST ACCRUED THEREON WHICH IS THE PROPERTY OF BUYER IN ALL EVENTS, AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.   THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE BY INITIALING THIS SECTION THAT SELLERS DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF THE BUYER DEFAULT WILL BE UNCERTAIN AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND IMPRACTICAL TO ASCERTAIN, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF SELLERS WITHDRAWAL OF THE PROPERTY FROM THE MARKET, ANY CHANGES IN THE OPERATION OF THE PROPERTY DURING THAT PERIOD, AND THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF PROSPECTIVE BUYERS.   THE PARTIES HAVE NEGOTIATED THE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, AND IT REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLERS DAMAGES CONSIDERING ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING ON THE DATE OF EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT.   THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PAYMENT OF SUCH AMOUNTS AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS NOT INTENDED AS A FORFEITURE OR PENALTY WITHIN THE MEANING OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTIONS 3275 OR 3369, BU
