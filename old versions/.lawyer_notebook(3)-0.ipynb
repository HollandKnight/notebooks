Use Many2Many to compare a large number of items (the 'Query') against another large groups of items (the 'Search') and determine matches. For example, a client requests we confirm the destruction of files relating to several hundred matters, where the matter description for each must be cross checked against several thousand entries in our file storage list. This tool leverages fuzzy matching in order to identify matches undetected by pure booleen searches (e.g., \"FIRST INTERNATIONAL\" captured even if search query is \"INTL FIRS\")"
